# Module 3: Integration Essay

## Activity Checklist

!! See the schedule for Module 3 [here](Schedule-for-Module-1.pdf)
!! Also refer to this [checklist](Module-1-Activity-Checklist.pdf) of learning activities and assessments

## Week 6
**The First Day of the class (Week 6-1)**

  - For this short announcement, do not spend more than 10 minutes. They
    need to spend the whole class time to complete “Class Activity 1.1”.

  - Explain the Module 3 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of
    M3 worksheet, M3 in-class writing, and M3 final essay.

  - Help students to find TWO important files given on Module 3 page in
    Moodle:

    1.  M3 Integration Essay Assignment (Instructions)

    2.  M3 Worksheet (Template)

    3.  M3 Worksheet (Example): (This hidden link will be open to
        students in Week 6-2.)

    4.  The news video link: (This hidden link will be open to students
        in Week 6-2.)

          - The case: “[Syrian Refugees in Canada facing challenges
            after one
            year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7uttRJskE)”

          - This is the case that they should watch in order to write
            their integration paper individually.

    5.  M3 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to
        students at the beginning of the LAST class (Week 8-1) before
        they turn off the wifi.)

  - Introduce the instructions of the Integration Essay Assignment and
    show where the files of M3 assignment instructions and worksheet.
    (**NOTE**: The news video for the case will be open to students at
    the end of the class on Week 6-2.)

*The information below is the ones that you already mentioned in Module
2. However, as a reminder, please inform the information below again “in
short” if necessary:*

  - There is also an M3- ongoing Dropbox where they can save their essay
    drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need
    to save their files such as “M3 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M3 draft
    2 (Your name)”. Even though you already mentioned this in Module 2,
    please remind them about the purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox
    again:

    6.  encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that
        can show a professor the process of their writing work.

    7.  avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can
        check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then
        continue their writing.

    8.  be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when
        they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the
        plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox,
        there will be a consequence based on the weight of their
        plagiarism issue.

  - The final essay dropbox will be automatically closed at the due
    time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
    mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the
    professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second
    chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes
    their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted
    their essay to the professor by email.

    9.  There might be one or two students whose final essay Dropbox
        doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error).
        In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M3
        ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file,
        too.

  - If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent
    issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should
    communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of
    sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official
    medical report.

  - Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will
    result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at
    the end of the semester.

  - When they email the professor, they should indicate their official
    (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will
    probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to
    indicate their identification clearly.

##
Topic 2: Thinking Stage

#### Class Activity 1.1 \[Topic 2- Understanding a Theory\]: (Group work: 3\~4 students per group) 6 wiki pages are needed for this activity/hidden view for students.

**Check your understanding of a theory given in Module 3 with your group
members**. To participate in this activity, you must read the two
articles before the class.

  - **Read** the two articles about Maslow’s theory given in Module 3 in
    advance.

  - You can find which level of the hierarchy of needs in Maslow’s
    theory and the name of your group members on the title of the wiki
    page assigned in Moodle.

      - Physiological needs

      - Safety needs

      - Belongingness and love needs

      - Needs for self-esteem

      - Needs for self-actualization

      - Needs for self-transcendence

  - With your group members, **select the most important theoretical
    concepts in the assigned hierarchy of needs**.

  - **Post** <span class="underline">3\~4 important concepts of the
    theory with proper quotation marks and citations to the designated
    wiki page</span> as a group by the end of the class. (NOTE: DO NOT
    paraphrase them, but just copy and paste the concepts with proper
    APA documentation.)

  - **\[HOMEWORK for the NEXT class\]:**

      - With your group members, **post a 3-minute presentation video to
        the same wiki page** **before the next class**.

      - **Individually, READ all the groups’ postings and WATCH each
        video to understand the entire theory. This is your own
        responsibility to do this homework.**

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

The SIX wiki pages have been hidden, so please make them visible to the
students when they need to do this activity in the class.

8.  Make sure that they have read the two articles in advance.

9.  The professor will indicate group members’ name directly on the wiki
    links like below.

    ![](media/image14.png)

      - Physiological needs (3\~4 students)

      - Safety needs (4\~5 students)

      - Belongingness and love needs (2 students)

      - Needs for self-esteem (2 students)

      - Needs for self-actualization (2 students)

      - Needs for self-transcendence (3\~4 students)

10. To access the wiki page, they need to click “HTML format” and then
    the button “Create page” like below.

    ![](media/image15.png)

11. To post 3\~4 quotes from the given article(s), they just need to
    copy and paste the information from the article(s) to the given wiki
    text space and then click the button “SAVE”.

    ![](media/image16.png)

12. To re-enter the wiki text space, they need to click the “Edit” tap
    given on the top left.

    ![](media/image17.png)

13. **They should NOT paraphrase the theory**. They just need to copy
    and paste the 3\~4 most important information of the theory with
    proper quotation marks and citations.

14. If some of the groups finish their wiki task early, encourage them
    to record their 3-minute group presentation. This video presentation
    is informal, so the video should not look fancy. They can use their
    cellphone or laptop camera to deliver the core meaning of their
    theory in the video clearly. Clarity of the content is important.

15. To post the video, they can upload it to Youtube or Google Drive to
    share its link. If these two are not available in their country, the
    facilitator can collect/save the videos to the “Stream” that TWU
    provides you with via Office 365. Then, share their links to the
    wiki pages on behalf of them. (If this doesn’t work for the
    facilitator, please consult with the professor.)

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s “contribution” to the group work ranged
    from 5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the professor by the
    end of the semester.

##

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Avoid basic grammar/spelling mistakes.

  - The academic tone that you learned in Module 1 is also important.
    Doublecheck if you have informal expressions in your essay.

  - These two areas will be also counted for your grade.
