# Module 2: Personal Response

## Activity Checklist

!! See the schedule for Module 2 [here](Schedule-for-Module-1.pdf)
!! Also refer to this [checklist](Module-1-Activity-Checklist.pdf) of learning activities and assessments

## Week 3-2
**The First Day of the class (Week 3-2)**

  - Explain the Module 2 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of
    M2 worksheet, M2 in-class writing, and M2 final essay.

  - Help students to find THREE important files given on Module 2 page
    in Moodle:

    1.  M2 Personal Response Assignment (Instructions)

    2.  M2 Worksheet (Template)

    3.  M2 Worksheet (Example)

    4.  M2 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to
        students at the beginning of the LAST class (Week 5-2) before
        they turn off the wifi.)

  - Introduce the instructions of the Personal Response Assignment. That
    is, READ the instructions for the students. Then, ask students to
    choose ONE topic from the topic list by the next class.

  - There is also an M2- ongoing dropbox where they can save their essay
    drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need
    to save their files such as “M2 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M2 draft
    2 (Your name)”. The purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox is to:

    5.  encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that
        can show a professor the process of their writing work.

    6.  avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can
        check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then
        continue their writing.

    7.  be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when
        they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the
        plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox,
        there will be a consequence based on the weight of their
        plagiarism issue.

  - The final essay dropbox will be automatically closed at the due
    time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
    mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the
    professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second
    chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes
    their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted
    their essay to the professor by email.

    8.  There might be one or two students whose final essay dropbox
        doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error).
        In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M2
        ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file,
        too.

  - If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent
    issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should
    communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of
    sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official
    medical report.

  - Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will
    result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at
    the end of the semester.

  - When they email the professor, they should indicate their official
    (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will
    probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to
    indicate their identification clearly.

## Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this module, you should be able to:

  - Explain what personal response is and how to apply it to university
    writing assignments.

  - Distinguish between primary and secondary sources.

  - Sketch the outline of the essay by selecting appropriate evidence to
    support a thesis statement. 

  - Express four different kinds of personal responses based on the
    given primary source.

  - Understand and apply deductive pattern from introduction to
    conclusion.

  - Apply APA formatting/documentation.

    individually.** You don’t have to answer all the questions given in
    the chart below, but choose the best 3\~5 questions that can help
    you to write meaningful responses.

    ![](media/image7.png)

3.  **Share your notes with your partners, and then identify the main
    topic** of the video <span class="underline">in ONE general

4.  Also, **select TWO important events** described in the video that

5.  Lastly, decide **your overall response** as a group.

page link for students when they need to do this activity in the class.

1.  Show the video “Remember Africville” for about 35 minutes.

2.  Students will need to take notes on the video based on the given
    WH-questions individually.

3.  After that, group 3\~4 students per group.

4.  Ask them to share their notes, and then identify THREE items below:

    1.  The main topic of the video in ONE general word.

    2.  Two important events described in the video that can support the
        main topic.

    3.  Your overall response (e.g. strong opinions).

5.  They can directly post their written work to the Forum page.

    how to write a thesis statement that consists of (A), (B), and (C).

    statement easily.

    have to worry about how to write a thesis statement. They will
    practice it in the next class. Next class, there might be around
    10-20 minute remaining time, so they have a chance to show you (a
    facilitator) their M2 worksheet and write their own thesis in their
    worksheet. If they follow this procedure, they can submit their
    worksheet on time.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

    to record each student’s contribution to the group work ranged from
    5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the professor by the end
    of the semester.

  - If the internet is out of service accidentally, you can use the
    article (M2 Reading 1- Individual Activity 1.4) for this class
    activity because the fundamental story of Africville is the same as
    the one described in the video. They will need to submit their
