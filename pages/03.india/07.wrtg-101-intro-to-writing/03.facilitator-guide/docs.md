# Lesson Notes for WRTG 101

The following provides key information for the WRTG 101 modules
(schedules, activity instructions, etc.). Please see the full course
notes on Moodle.

# Module 1: Introduction to Academic Writing

See the schedule for Module 1 [here](Schedule-for-Module-1.pdf)

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]: The First Day of the class (Week 1-1)**

  - Print out the Course Syllabus and the Student Survey form given on
    our course site. Give them to our students on the first day of the
    class.

  - Give students 15-20 minutes to read the course syllabus and help
    them understand it if necessary.

  - Then, give students about 30 minutes to complete the student survey
    form and submit it to you by the end of the class.

  - Scan the forms and save them in one file as PDF, and send it to the
    professor by email.

  - Introduce [how to get into
    Moodle](https://www.twu.ca/students/current-students) and show them
    how to navigate their dashboard in Moodle. Also, if you have
    remaining time, introduce [the Writing center support online (i.e.
    Writeaway)](https://www.twu.ca/student-life/student-success/writing-centre).
    If you don’t have enough time, please introduce it next class.

  - Attendance (and participation) can be recorded in this file. This
    file can be shared via Google.doc if preferred by both the
    instructor and facilitator. Please communicate with the professor.
    This attendance record should be reported to the professor by the
    last day of the semester.

    (About participation, check Class Activity 1.2 section. Its details
    are given there.)

  - **\[IMPORTANT Announcement to students\]**:

      - The facilitator will take attendance throughout this semester,
        so don’t miss the class. Your class attendance will be counted
        for the final grade of this course. Also, if you miss the class
        over 25%, you are NOT allowed to take a final exam (50%). Check
        the course syllabus for more details.

      - All individual activities which are formative learning
        activities will be graded. Whenever you finish one individual
        activity, you will receive “a full mark”, 5 points because your
        professor value the process of your spontaneous study. Please
        diligently work on these individual activities.

## Topic 1: Academic Writing Basics

#### Class Activity 1.1 \[APA Template\]: (Individual work)

**Create an individual APA template (Microsoft document only)** based on
the instructions in Topic 2, and submit it to the designated Dropbox
given on our course site by the end of your class time. Submissions out
of the class time will not be accepted.

\[NOTE\]:

  - Be sure to bring your laptop to class and install Microsoft Word
    before class starts. Check with your facilitator for specific
    instructions on submitting this template to your instructor.

<!-- end list -->

  - Note that this activity is a part of your participation mark for
    this course.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

1.  Students should bring their own laptop to create their APA template.
    The reason is that their professor will check the authorship of the
    APA template to identify their plagiarism issue(s) possible during
    this semester.

2.  Students should install the official Microsoft Word. Please check if
    they have it or not in on the first day of the semester and inform
    that they should be ready to use it for creating APA template in the
    class under your administration.

3.  Students can freely check course materials and watch videos while
    creating their template.

4.  The file title of their APA template should be “APA template
    (Student’s official name)”.

5.  Please check if students’ submissions are appropriately completed
    before they leave the class.

6.  Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

## Topic 3: APA Documentation

**Class Activity 1.2 \[Paraphrasing & APA documentation\]:** (Group
work: 3\~4 students per group) *– Forum page hidden view for students*

**There are 4 paragraphs about Terry Fox as a Canadian symbol on the
Canada’s History web page.** With your group partners, you will
paraphrase the first 3 paragraphs fully in your own words and indicate
proper citations. Then you will post your group work to the Forum page
given on our course site by the end of the class. Your professor will
give you brief written feedback online with a participation mark.

  - Reading: [History Idol: Terry
    Fox](https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/arts,-culture-society/history-idol-terry-fox)

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

This activity forum page has been hidden, so please activate the forum
page link for students when they need to do this activity in the class.
Ask students to read the 4 paragraphs about Terry Fox as a Canadian
symbol on the Canada’s History web page. They will paraphrase the first
3 paragraphs and submit their work as a group to the Moodle Dropbox
during class time.

1.  Grouping 3 students per group is ideal, but a group of 4 is
    possible.

2.  DO NOT let them work individually. Encourage students to paraphrase
    each paragraph TOGETHER step by step.

3.  Students can freely check course materials while paraphrasing.

4.  They can either submit a Word file or directly post their written
    work to the Forum page.

> *<span class="underline">How to post their work to the Forum

1.  Click “Add a new discussion topic”.

2.  Write down each group members’ name in the “Subject” section.

3.  Post their work to the “Message” section or upload their file to the
    “Attachment” section.

4.  Click “Post to forum”.

<!-- end list -->

5.  Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

6.  Please use the excel file provided below in order to record each
    student’s contribution to the group work ranged from 5 to 0. You
    will need to send the file to the professor by the end of the
    semester. The example excel file is attached here. (This file can
    also be shared via Google.doc if both the instructor and facilitator
    prefer.)

7.  (If the internet is out of service accidentally, you can print out
    the article and give it to them. They can submit their hand-written
    work to you, but you need to scan their work and send it to the
    professor.)

**Class Activity 1.3 \[References\]:** (Group work: 5 students per
group)

*– Forum page Hidden view for students*

**FIVE different sources are given on this forum page.** With your group
partners, make a references list in alphabetical order on a Microsoft
Word document. Post your group work to the Forum page by the end of the
class. Your professor will give you brief written feedback online with a
participation mark.

1.  Grouping 5 students per group is ideal, but if some groups have less
    than 5 students, one or two students may need to complete more than
    one source.

2.  Each group member is assigned to finish one source out of 5. After
    all group members finish organizing their source, combine them in
    one file and organize them in alphabetical order. Then, give them
    time to give each other feedback and revise their work.

3.  Students can freely check course materials while making the
    references list.

4.  They should directly upload their Word file as a group to the Forum
    page by the end of the class.

  - How to activate the Turnitin dropbox?

      - Click the APA quiz dropbox link.

      - There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of the
        dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the “I
        agree” box and click “OK”.

      - Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that they
        can submit their file to the dropbox.

  - If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate it,
    direct them to submit their file to the previous APA template
    dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then, please inform the
    issue to the professor by email immediately.

## Topic 4: Academic Tone

## Assessment

In Module 1, you participated in a number of in-class activities,
including creating an individual APA template, paraphrasing paragraphs
from a website, and making a references list. These three assignments
are to be completed in class and submitted to the professor via Moodle
Dropbox or Forum pages. Check with your Facilitator for exact dates and
submission instructions.

In addition to the in-class assignments, there are seven individual
activities, but the Individual Activities 1.1\~1.3 are only graded. You
will receive 5 points for the “completion” of each activity. Please

### APA Quiz: 5%

After you have completed Module 1, you will take an in-class quiz.
Please read the details below and study the Module 1 materials and
practice activities. Check with your Facilitator for the exact date of
the exam.

  - **Duration of the exam: Total- 1 hour and 30 minutes.**

      - Part 1 & 2: 40 minutes.

      - Part 3: 50 minutes

  - **The Quiz consists of:**

      - Part 1: True/False (20 marks)

      - Part 2: Multiple choices- A, B, C, D style (20 marks)

      - Part 3: APA writing task (60 marks)- One short article about a
        Canadian icon will be given.

        1.  **Write ONE paragraph- 150-200 words**

        2.  **Use YOUR APA template** (The failure of using your APA
            template automatically results in "0" mark on the writing
            task. That is, don't borrow your friend's APA template.)

        3.  **Decide your own title based on the given reading
            article.**

        4.  **Essay Type that you need to indicate on your title page is
            APA Essay**

        5.  **Include 2 pieces of evidence** from the given article.

              - *One direct quotation and the other paraphrased*

              - *OR two pieces of evidence can be all paraphrased in
                your own words.*

Before this quiz, please be sure that you have revised your APA template
based on my APA tutorial videos and APA Template Setup Checklist \[NOTE:
if you have technical difficulties, please talk to your facilitator.\].
You must use your APA template to complete a writing task for the quiz.
If not, the mark of your part 3 will be “0”.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

  - The quiz materials will be open to the facilitator 1\~2 days earlier
    (This can be negotiated by communications based on the facilitator’s
    situation. This is because school administrators who want their
    students to get a good mark and pass the course might give pressure
    to the facilitator to show the exam materials to them in advance.)

      - As soon as the quiz materials are up, the facilitator can print
        out Part 1 and 2 and prepare Scantron.

      - For Part 3, as soon as students are done with Part 1 and 2,
        collect their exam materials and scantrons. After that, ask them
        to open their laptop and their APA template. Then, you activate
        the Part 3 reading PDF link hidden on the Module 1 page when the
        students are ready to start Part 3. Be sure that they need to
        refresh their Module 1 page so that they can see the Part 3
        reading file that you just activated.

  - Inform this information to students 1 week earlier.

      - Students should bring their laptop for the test. IF not, their
        mark on part 3 will be “0”.

      - Part 1 and 2 will be done in Scantron. Thus, students also need
        to bring a pencil and eraser.

      - Students should use their OWN APA template for part 3. IF not,
        their mark on part 3 will be “0”.

  - By the END of the exam, students must upload their APA template
    (i.e. the completion of part 3) to the dropbox given on the Module 1
    course site. **\[IMPORTANT\]:** Please check if they successfully
    upload their file to the given Dropbox or not before they leave the
    classroom.

      - ![](media/image2.png)This dropbox is Turnitin dropbox which is
        different from regular dropbox. You will need to help students
        to activate their Turnitin dropbox one week earlier for the APA
        quiz. Please find time for this in advance.

      - How to activate the Turnitin dropbox?

        6.  Click the APA quiz dropbox link.

        7.  There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of
            the dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the
            “I agree” box and click “OK”.

        8.  Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that
            they can submit their file to the dropbox.

      - If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate
        it, direct them to submit their file to the previous APA
        template dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then,
        please inform the issue to the professor by email immediately.

  - The facilitator will receive the answer keys within 24 hours, so
    evaluate all the students’ part 1 and 2, and then send the results
    to the professor by email immediately in 24 hours after the quiz.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]: The First Day of the class (Week 3-2)**

  - Explain the Module 2 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of
    M2 worksheet, M2 in-class writing, and M2 final essay.

  - Help students to find THREE important files given on Module 2 page
    in Moodle:

    1.  M2 Personal Response Assignment (Instructions)

    2.  M2 Worksheet (Template)

    3.  M2 Worksheet (Example)

    4.  M2 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to
        students at the beginning of the LAST class (Week 5-2) before
        they turn off the wifi.)

  - Introduce the instructions of the Personal Response Assignment. That
    is, READ the instructions for the students. Then, ask students to
    choose ONE topic from the topic list by the next class.

  - There is also an M2- ongoing dropbox where they can save their essay
    drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need
    to save their files such as “M2 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M2 draft
    2 (Your name)”. The purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox is to:

    5.  encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that
        can show a professor the process of their writing work.

    6.  avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can
        check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then
        continue their writing.

    7.  be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when
        they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the
        plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox,
        there will be a consequence based on the weight of their
        plagiarism issue.

  - The final essay dropbox will be automatically closed at the due
    time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
    mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the
    professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second
    chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes
    their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted
    their essay to the professor by email.

    8.  There might be one or two students whose final essay dropbox
        doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error).
        In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M2
        ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file,
        too.

  - If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent
    issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should
    communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of
    sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official
    medical report.

  - Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will
    result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at
    the end of the semester.

  - When they email the professor, they should indicate their official
    (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will
    probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to
    indicate their identification clearly.

## Learning Outcomes

When you have completed this module, you should be able to:

  - Explain what personal response is and how to apply it to university
    writing assignments.

  - Distinguish between primary and secondary sources.

  - Sketch the outline of the essay by selecting appropriate evidence to
    support a thesis statement. 

  - Express four different kinds of personal responses based on the
    given primary source.

  - Understand and apply deductive pattern from introduction to
    conclusion.

  - Apply APA formatting/documentation.

    individually.** You don’t have to answer all the questions given in
    the chart below, but choose the best 3\~5 questions that can help
    you to write meaningful responses.

    ![](media/image7.png)

3.  **Share your notes with your partners, and then identify the main
    topic** of the video <span class="underline">in ONE general
    word</span>.

4.  Also, **select TWO important events** described in the video that

page link for students when they need to do this activity in the class.

1.  Show the video “Remember Africville” for about 35 minutes.

2.  Students will need to take notes on the video based on the given
    WH-questions individually.

3.  After that, group 3\~4 students per group.

4.  Ask them to share their notes, and then identify THREE items below:

    1.  The main topic of the video in ONE general word.

    2.  Two important events described in the video that can support the
        main topic.

    3.  Your overall response (e.g. strong opinions).

5.  They can directly post their written work to the Forum page.

> *<span class="underline">How to post their work to the Forum
> page?</span>*

    10-20 minute remaining time, so they have a chance to show you (a
    facilitator) their M2 worksheet and write their own thesis in their
    worksheet. If they follow this procedure, they can submit their
    worksheet on time.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Avoid basic grammar/spelling mistakes.

  - The academic tone that you learned in Module 1 is also important.
    Doublecheck if you have informal expressions in your essay.

  - These two areas will be also counted for your grade.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]: The First Day of the class (Week 6-1)**

  - For this short announcement, do not spend more than 10 minutes. They
    need to spend the whole class time to complete “Class Activity 1.1”.

  - Explain the Module 3 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of
    M3 worksheet, M3 in-class writing, and M3 final essay.

  - Help students to find TWO important files given on Module 3 page in
    Moodle:

    1.  M3 Integration Essay Assignment (Instructions)

    2.  M3 Worksheet (Template)

    3.  M3 Worksheet (Example): (This hidden link will be open to
        students in Week 6-2.)

    4.  The news video link: (This hidden link will be open to students
        in Week 6-2.)

          - The case: “[Syrian Refugees in Canada facing challenges
            after one
            year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7uttRJskE)”

          - This is the case that they should watch in order to write
            their integration paper individually.

    5.  M3 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to
        students at the beginning of the LAST class (Week 8-1) before
        they turn off the wifi.)

  - Introduce the instructions of the Integration Essay Assignment and
    show where the files of M3 assignment instructions and worksheet.
    (**NOTE**: The news video for the case will be open to students at
    the end of the class on Week 6-2.)

*The information below is the ones that you already mentioned in Module
2. However, as a reminder, please inform the information below again “in
short” if necessary:*

  - There is also an M3- ongoing Dropbox where they can save their essay
    drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need
    to save their files such as “M3 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M3 draft
    2 (Your name)”. Even though you already mentioned this in Module 2,
    please remind them about the purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox
    again:

    6.  encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that
        can show a professor the process of their writing work.

    7.  avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can
        check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then
        continue their writing.

    8.  be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when
        they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the
        plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox,
        there will be a consequence based on the weight of their
        plagiarism issue.

  - The final essay dropbox will be automatically closed at the due
    time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
    mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the
    professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second
    chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes
    their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted
    their essay to the professor by email.

    9.  There might be one or two students whose final essay Dropbox
        doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error).
        In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M3
        ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file,
        too.

  - If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent
    issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should
    communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of
    sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official
    medical report.

  - Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will
    result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at
    the end of the semester.

  - When they email the professor, they should indicate their official
    (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will
    probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to
    indicate their identification clearly.

##   
Topic 2: Thinking Stage

#### Class Activity 1.1 \[Topic 2- Understanding a Theory\]: (Group work: 3\~4 students per group) 6 wiki pages are needed for this activity/hidden view for students.

**Check your understanding of a theory given in Module 3 with your group
members**. To participate in this activity, you must read the two
articles before the class.

  - **Read** the two articles about Maslow’s theory given in Module 3 in
    advance.

  - You can find which level of the hierarchy of needs in Maslow’s
    theory and the name of your group members on the title of the wiki
    page assigned in Moodle.

      - Physiological needs

      - Safety needs

      - Belongingness and love needs

      - Needs for self-esteem

      - Needs for self-actualization

      - Needs for self-transcendence

  - With your group members, **select the most important theoretical
    concepts in the assigned hierarchy of needs**.

  - **Post** <span class="underline">3\~4 important concepts of the
    theory with proper quotation marks and citations to the designated
    wiki page</span> as a group by the end of the class. (NOTE: DO NOT
    paraphrase them, but just copy and paste the concepts with proper
    APA documentation.)

  - **\[HOMEWORK for the NEXT class\]:**

      - With your group members, **post a 3-minute presentation video to
        the same wiki page** **before the next class**.

      - **Individually, READ all the groups’ postings and WATCH each
        video to understand the entire theory. This is your own
        responsibility to do this homework.**

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

The SIX wiki pages have been hidden, so please make them visible to the
students when they need to do this activity in the class.

8.  Make sure that they have read the two articles in advance.

9.  The professor will indicate group members’ name directly on the wiki
    links like below.

    ![](media/image14.png)

      - Physiological needs (3\~4 students)

      - Safety needs (4\~5 students)

      - Belongingness and love needs (2 students)

      - Needs for self-esteem (2 students)

      - Needs for self-actualization (2 students)

      - Needs for self-transcendence (3\~4 students)

10. To access the wiki page, they need to click “HTML format” and then
    the button “Create page” like below.

    ![](media/image15.png)

11. To post 3\~4 quotes from the given article(s), they just need to
    copy and paste the information from the article(s) to the given wiki
    text space and then click the button “SAVE”.

    ![](media/image16.png)

12. To re-enter the wiki text space, they need to click the “Edit” tap
    given on the top left.

    ![](media/image17.png)

13. **They should NOT paraphrase the theory**. They just need to copy
    and paste the 3\~4 most important information of the theory with
    proper quotation marks and citations.

14. If some of the groups finish their wiki task early, encourage them
    to record their 3-minute group presentation. This video presentation
    is informal, so the video should not look fancy. They can use their
    cellphone or laptop camera to deliver the core meaning of their
    theory in the video clearly. Clarity of the content is important.

15. To post the video, they can upload it to Youtube or Google Drive to
    share its link. If these two are not available in their country, the
    facilitator can collect/save the videos to the “Stream” that TWU
    provides you with via Office 365. Then, share their links to the
    wiki pages on behalf of them. (If this doesn’t work for the
    facilitator, please consult with the professor.)

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s “contribution” to the group work ranged
    from 5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the professor by the
    end of the semester.

##

4.  While they are writing a body paragraph, please make sure if they
    are clearly following the body paragraph structure or not. If not,
    help them to check the two examples of the body paragraph.

5.  They can directly post their written work to the Forum page.

> *<span class="underline">How to post their work to the Forum
> page?</span>*

1.  Click “Add a new discussion topic”.

2.  Write down each group members’ name in the “Subject” section.

3.  Post their work to the “Message”

4.  Click “Post to forum”.

<!-- end list -->

1.  It is fine for students to post an “incomplete” paragraph as the
    focus of this activity is to let them experience how to write a body
    paragraph. Thus, just let them post what they have at the end of the
    class.

2.  **Homework announcement:**

<!-- end list -->

  - Remind/highlight the deadline of their M3 worksheet: by the end of
    the next class.

    They need to submit their worksheet to M3 Ongoing Dropbox.

  - Because of the deadline, they will need to bring their worksheet
    mostly 80% completed to the next class. Their facilitator will check
    their completion and may be able to check their thesis statement and
    give them brief feedback at least ( this is optional).

  - Remind them that M3 in-class writing (8%) will be on the LAST class
    of the 5<sup>th</sup> week in Module 3.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s contribution to the group work ranged from
    5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the professor by the end
    of the semester.

#### Class Activity 1.4 \[Finalizing M3 Worksheet\]: (Individual work)

**You have a full class time (75 minutes) to complete your M3
worksheet**. Spend the time finalizing your worksheet effectively and
submit your worksheet to M3 Ongoing dropbox by the end of the class. I
will receive your professor feedback in 2\~3 days.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

  - While students are working on their worksheet, check their thesis
    statement if you feel comfortable checking it. You are not
    responsible for their content but can check their grammatical
    issues.

  - If possible, doublecheck if they are using proper sources.

      - Theory: The TWO Maslow’s articles that the professor has
        provided them with.

      - Case: “[Syrian Refugees in Canada facing challenges after one
        year](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VU7uttRJskE)”

  - Remind students that M3 in-class writing (8%) will proceed on the
    LAST class of the 5<sup>th</sup> week in Module 3.

<!-- end list -->

  - For 75 minutes, they will write a body paragraph.

  - They will use an M3 in-class writing template provided in Moodle.

  - They should NOT be late or absent on that day.

      - Those who came late for the class will not be given any extra
        time.

      - Absentees will receive a “zero” grade automatically.

<!-- end list -->

  - They should be on time and bring their laptop and a laptop charger.

  - During the in-class writing, they are only allowed to check their
    worksheet and Maslow’s articles.

  - They should turn off the wifi before the in-class writing starts.

  - They are NOT allowed to use any translators during the in-class
    writing. Using a dictionary is fine.

  - At the end of the class, ALL the students turn on the wifi, and then
    submit their file to M3 on-going dropbox.

**\[NOTE\]:**

  - Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

  - Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order
    to record each student’s effort to work on their worksheet ranged
    from 5 to 0. You will need to send the file to the professor by the
    end of the semester.

## Assessment

In Module 3, you participated in a number of in-class activities and
