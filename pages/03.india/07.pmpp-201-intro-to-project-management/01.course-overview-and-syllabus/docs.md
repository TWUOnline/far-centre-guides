**Course Policies:**
--------------------

### Missed Speech Day Policy:

>   Please be ready for your scheduled day. If you miss your day for any reason
>   besides severe illness or other extenuating circumstances, you will be
>   required to speak at the tail end of all other speeches, and you will
>   receive an automatic reduction of 15 points. This is a gracious policy
>   compared to the consequences of not being ready for a life speech. Please
>   contact the Facilitator immediately when you feel you are unable to speak
>   (for whatever reason).

### **Long or Short Speech Policy:**

>   What happens if you go significantly short or long on your speech? It’s hard
>   to provide a cut-and-dry rule because some ‘too short’ speeches are very
>   good in all other respects, and some ‘long speeches’ have terrific ‘added
>   value.’ But the general rule is that for every one minute short or long, 3
>   points are deducted from your score. This respects the cultural expectation
>   that speaking events last certain lengths of time, and it guarantees
>   everyone who signed up to speak that day is allowed to (i.e., no one gets
>   bumped due to three long speakers!)

### Inclusive Classroom:

>   TWU is committed to an ethic of inclusion centred on the principles of
>   hospitality, reciprocity and reconciliation. We seek to produce generous
>   learning spaces that are based on respect for difference and are open to
>   diverse views, opinions, and identities. We welcome and value all voices,
>   including those that have been silenced on account of race, religious
>   beliefs, colour, gender, physical or mental variations, age, ancestry, place
>   of origin, marital status, family status, sex, and sexual orientation, or on
>   any other grounds identified in applicable human rights law.
