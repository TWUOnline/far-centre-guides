In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

## Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the classroom.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next class.  In class, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.  

| **Unit topics**                                           | **Activities / Assessment**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

## Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the textbook chapters, the overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning activities.  Learning activities include questions that we ask students to answer in a Reflective Journal (graded and ungraded), videos that explain topics further, and an ungraded key terms quiz. As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class (e.g. Reflective journal due Wednesday in order to participate in discussion and submit to instructor on Moodle by Friday.



## Class Assignments & Learning Activities 
Note that many classes will be devoted to certain assignments (discussions, ethics committee, presentations).  Below are the assignment details. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.

### Assignment Notes
See full Assignment details in the Assessments section of the course on Moodle.

## Reflective Journal and Discussions
Throughout this course, students will be invited to write about what they are learning
in a Reflective Journal. You should consider your journal as a place for you to
try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and possibly share what you are
learning with your community. Students will also discuss their responses in class.

Empasize to students that this is a philosophy class.  The point of philosophy is to provide reasons for what you believe, and to be open to the possibility that your beliefs may change when presented with contrary reasons or evidence.  If students are to succeed in this class they must always back up everything they say with reasons that might be acceptable to others.  For example, disagreeing with a particular author simply because you don’t like what he or she is saying is not enough.  Alternatively, agreeing with an article because it confirms what you already believe is also not enough.  Students must always seek to give reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with an argument.  Both in class discussions and written assignments, just saying that you like or agree with a certain view will be discouraged.

This Reflective Journal assessment is worth 30% of the course grade. Students will complete a
Reflective Journal entry for Units 1, 4, 7, 8, and 9 (6% each).

#### Instructions:

There are three steps to submitting the Reflective Journal:

>   **Step 1:** Respond to the questions presented in the unit.

>   **Step 2:** Discuss your reflections in class. Take notes on key learning
>   from the discussion.

>   **Step 3:** Submit your final Reflective Journal entry to your professor via
>   the Moodle assignment dropbox. Be sure to include any final ideas you
>   learned through the class discussions.


Note: In the online course, we give several prompts for students to think about.  As you review the unit and plan your week, consider the questions that would inspire an engaging group/class discussion.

## Ethics Committee Responses (30%)

Throughout this course, you will work with a group of your peers, assuming the
role of an Ethics Committee. This committee will meet six times throughout this
course to discuss issues and then create a summary report. Submit your response
to your professor via the Moodle assignment dropbox.

Each report is worth 5%, for a total of 30% of your course grade. You will
complete a Ethics Committee Response for Units 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 10 (5% each).


## Ethics Video (10%)

For this assignment, you’ll be asked to create a 2 minute video articulating a
moral viewpoint on one of the following issues: free speech, sexual morality,
abortion, euthanasia, or torture.  (Units 5-9 topics). Then, drawing upon the
readings, make a concise case for this viewpoint.

Your video must include the following elements:

-   A clear statement of the ethical issue being addressed: what is the ethical
    question at hand?

-   Your proposed answer to this question.

-   At least one reason for your answer.

-   A professional and well-prepared appearance to the video as a whole: this
    may require rehearsing it once or twice.

This video must be posted on Moodle by the end of week 9.  If you choose to post
it online outside of Moodle (e.g. YouTube), please provide the URL. You are also
asked to respond to at least 3 of your peers videos.


## Assignment: Partner Project Presentation (30%) (Units 5-10)

For this partner project, students will choose a specific ethical issue to address.
Please note that this is an argumentative project and not simply a discussion
project. The presentations should be 12-15 minutes in length and have a visual
element (e.g. PowerPoint). Students will also have an additional 10 minutes at the
end of the presentation to answer questions and facilitate a class discussion.

Note that this assignment will be presented during weeks 5-10. **Students must choose a partner and topic by week 4 at the latest** (see week 5-10 topics). The Facilitator should hand out a sign-up sheet when the assignment is introduced (in week 3 or 4).

See assignment details, including the *grading criteria* in the Assessments section of this course.



### Key Terms Review Activities
Each unit has a key terms matching activity.  If there is class time (e.g. for an ice-breaker opening activity or the close of a lesson), engage students in some vocabulary activities.  

Here are a couple of examples:

- Word Sort: See instructions in [Faculty Focus: A New Way to Help Students Learn Course Vocabulary](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/a-new-way-to-help-students-learn-course-vocabulary/)
- Semantic maps, Vocab on the Move, Brain Power Words: See instructions in [21 Ideas for Teaching Vocabulary](http://www.giftedguru.com/21_ideas_for_teaching_vocabulary/)
- [Vocabulary Building](https://www.saddleback.edu/tutoring/vocabulary-building)
- Guess Who? Prepare name tag stickers with philosophy perspectives (e.g. nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist, utilitarian, etc.). Put the sticker on students backs and have them mingle, trying to guess from other's desciption what perspective they have.
-
