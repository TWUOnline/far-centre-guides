# Facilitator Notes

In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

## Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the classroom.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next class.  In class, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.

## Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the textbook chapters, the overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning activities.  Learning activities include questions that we ask students to answer in a Reflective Journal (graded and ungraded), videos that explain topics further, and an ungraded key terms quiz. As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class (e.g. Reflective journal due Wednesday in order to participate in discussion and submit to instructor on Moodle by Friday.


## Class Activities

### Discussions
Empasize to students that this is a philosophy class.  The point of philosophy is to provide reasons for what you believe, and to be open to the possibility that your beliefs may change when presented with contrary reasons or evidence.  If you are to succeed in this class you must always back up everything you say with reasons that might be acceptable to others.  For example, disagreeing with a particular author simply because you don’t like what he or she is saying is not enough.  Alternatively, agreeing with an article because it confirms what you already believe is also not enough.  You must always seek to give reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with an argument.  Both in class discussions and written assignments, just saying that you like or agree with a certain view will be discouraged.

In the online course, we give several prompts for students to think about.  As you review the unit and plan your week, consider the questions that would inspire an engaging group/class discussion.
