###Unit 3: Civilizations and Encounters During the Third Wave Era, c. 600 - 1450

####Unit 3 Topic 1

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are activities to help students understand chapters 6 & 7:

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

**Comparison (large or small group)** “The impact of long-distance trade.”

Ask students to make a list of the ways in which people and regions can be affected, directly or indirectly, by commerce. Then distribute world maps and ask students to identify which regions of the earth weren’t affected in a significant way by long-distance trade in the period 600–1450 C.E.

**Contextualization (large or small group)** “What makes trade tick?”

Encourage a discussion of the necessary preconditions for long-distance trade to develop. The textbook provides considerable material for this question, especially in the case of the Americas, but the purpose of this discussion is to get students to reason out the answer for themselves based on what they have learned in class already.

**Role-playing exercise (small group)** “Crossing the world.”

You are the followers of Ibn Battuta in the fourteenth century c.e.You want to travel from Timbuktu (West Africa) to Cholas (India). How would you do it? Consider:
   •   the various means of transportation you would need
   •   your probable route
   •   how long your journey would probably take

**Analysis exercise (large or small group).** “The big picture.”

With the class, lay out in chart form the key similarities and differences between Korea, Vietnam, and Japan.

This will schematize material in the chapter and will also model an effective study technique for students. On the chart, be sure to include at least the following elements:

   •   when each state was unified
   •   the degree to which the government was centralized
   •   the degree of Chinese influence on government
   •   influence of Chinese scholarship on the elite
   •   influence of other cultural elements on the elite
   •   position of women in society before Chinese influence
   •   position of women in society after Chinese influence began
   •   main religious beliefs
   •   degree of Chinese influence on popular religious beliefs

####Unit 3 Topic 2

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are classroom activities to help students understand chapters 9 & 10 :

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group.
***Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade*** [link to participation grade rubric]

**Comparison (large or small group)** “Women in the third-wave civilizations.”

Ask students to discuss which of the third-wave civilizations offered the most favorable conditions for women. (Be sure to encourage them to consider the difference made by social class)

**Contextualization (large or small group)** “In the year 1200: Who’s ‘winning’?”

Ask students to compare conditions in the Islamic world, China, and Western Europe in the year 1200 c.e.and to answer the question of which society, at that time, seemed the most likely to win a “most dominant society of the world” contest. Encourage them to chart how they would rank each civilization on a number of points that the members of the class regard as important, such as religious tolerance, economic prosperity, gender equality, population, innovation, and so on.

**Contextualization (large or small group)** “Faith or reason—the longest argument.”

This chapter presents the development of tension between faith and reason in medieval Europe. Ask students to:

   •   lay out the main reasons why this tension developed in the medieval context
   •   discuss which medieval factors are still part of the modern faith/reason debate
   •   discuss which factors are unique to the modern world

**Map-analysis exercise (large or small group)** “A fragmented Europe.”

If possible, display to the class a physical map of Europe that includes modern political borders. Ask your students to:

   •   identify the geographical elements that contributed to European political fragmentation (mountains, major rivers, etc.—but be sure to remind them that rivers and bodies of water can often facilitate contact)
   •   identify the regions where separate states formed for no clear geographical reason (look especially at Eastern Europe for this)
   •   discuss what other factors made for fragmentation in regions where no physical reason is apparent

####Unit 3 Topic 3

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are classroom activities to help students understand chapter 11:

**Discussion question review (small group)**
Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

**Comparison (large or small group)** “Women in agricultural and pastoral societies.”

Ask students whether it was better to be a woman than a man in a pastoral or a farming society, and ask them to explain why. Make sure they consider both elites and commoners.

**Contextualization (large or small group)** “How Temujin became Chinggis Khan.”

Distribute to the class the passage of The Secret History of the Mongols in which the young Temujin first begins to build up a following from among the Mongol tribes (chs. 2 & 3). Ask the students to discuss how he does it. Some supplementary questions to ask are:

   •   Is money involved?
   •   What can Temujin offer to his followers?
   •   What’s the glue that holds the confederation together?
   •   What sort of interpersonal relationships are revealed by the text?

**Map-analysis exercise (large or small group)** “Where were the nomads?”

Using a physical map of the world, ask students to locate the territory of the following groups of pastoral nomads:

   •   Scythians
   •   Xiongnu
   •   Huns
   •   Magyars
   •   Turks
   •   Mongols
   •   Tibetans
   •   Lapps
   •   Bedouin
   •   Masai

Then ask students to discuss why these regions might have been particularly suitable for nomads.
