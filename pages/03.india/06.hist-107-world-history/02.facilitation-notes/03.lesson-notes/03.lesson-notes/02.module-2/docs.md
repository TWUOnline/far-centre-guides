# Unit 2: Continuity and Change in the Second-Wave Era, 600 BCE to 600CE

Unit 2 Topic 1

Notes for Facilitator:

Here are activities to help students understand chapters 3 & 4:

Discussion question review (small group)

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric] Large group discussion: Divide the class into two camps, Persian and Greek. Each side should prepare debating points on why they should be regarded as the most civilized. (Be sure to put some strong students on the Persian side, because the evidence is more difficult to extract.)

Small group discussion: Divide students into small groups to discuss whether they think democracy is inherently superior to monarchy, and if so, why.

Map analysis (large or small group).

Ask the students to examine the maps provided in Chapter 3 and then to discuss the following questions:

●	Which second-wave empire had a geographical setting that was most conducive to empire?
●	Can geography explain the failure of the Mauryan Empire in India?
●	Do geographical reasons explain why democracy evolved in Greece but not in the areas where second-wave empires developed?

Image analysis (large or small group).

Ask students to examine two of the images provided in chapters 3 & 4, one each from two different cultures, and to discuss:
•   whether they believe the image expresses in some way the essence of the religion/cultural tradition it illustrates
•   whether the artistic tradition followed affects how much meaning they can get from the image
•   how the artist of one of the two images may have depicted the scene in the other

Role-playing exercise 1 (small group).

You are Chinese officials in the service of Wangdi, sent on a diplomatic trip to Rome.

●	What do you think would most surprise you about the Roman Empire?
●	What would seem most familiar?
●	How would your visit be different from a visit to India?

Role-playing exercise 2 (small group).

The class is a group of Ethiopian royal counselors in the third century c.e. Select three groups of students to play the roles of missionaries from Buddhism, Christianity, and Zoroastrianism (this isn’t as silly as it may sound, since India had regular trade contact with eastern Africa by this time and the Persian Gulf isn’t that far away). Have each group make a short presentation on why the king of Ethiopia should convert to their religion, and then allow the rest of the class to vote, based on the quality of the presentations.

Unit 2 Topic 2

Notes for Facilitator:

Here are classroom activities to help students understand chapter 5:

Discussion question review (small group)

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

Comparison topic (large or small group): “Why did empires vary in their approach to slavery?”

Questions to consider include:

   •   The Mauryan Empire, just like the Roman Empire, was created by conquest, yet it had fewer slaves. Why?
   •   Classical Greeks prided themselves on their democracy, yet they had nearly as many slaves as the Romans did. What can this teach you about the relationship between or attitudes of the two societies?
   •   Slavery was relatively unimportant in China. Why?
   •   Can we draw any general lessons about why slavery flourished in some second-wave societies but not in others?
Contextualization (large or small group): “Modern views of Roman slavery.”
Show a clip from the classic movie Spartacus from 1960 (preferably the one in which Spartacus makes an impassioned speech in favor of liberty).
Then ask students to discuss the following questions:
   •   Do you think the real Spartacus acted this way? Why or why not?
   •   What did Spartacus want?
   •   What 1960 societal influences had an affect on the way the movie was conceived?

Misconception/Difficult Topic (large or small group): “Only women are ‘oppressed’ in a patriarchy.”

Ask the students to identify common threads of female subordination in the various civilizations covered in Chapter 5.

Have students use these common threads as a starting point to ask the question “What percentage of the male population do you think suffered similar limitations?” Encourage the students to consider how “free” peasants, commoners, and slaves were. Try to go beyond that to a consideration of how sons were usually subject to their fathers (including in matters such as marriage), and the lot of the poor, whether male or female.

Unit 3 Topic 3

Notes for Facilitator:

Here are two classroom activities to help students understand chapter 6:

Discussion question review (small group)

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

Misconception/Difficult Topic (large or small group): “Africa is the ‘Dark Continent.’”

Note: This would not be an appropriate question to ask students in the African FAR centre. An alternative discussion topic is listed below.

Ask students to discuss what they knew about African history before taking this class and where they learned it. Some supplemental questions are:

   •   Was the history of Africa covered in any detail in high school? Junior high? Grade school?
   •   Were students taught any misinformation about Africa, such as that all Africans lived in tribes or were ignorant of iron technology?
   •   What do they know about present-day Africa?

Alternative class discussion topic for the African FAR centre:

To what extent does the depiction of African history in the textbook correspond to how you have learned about the history of the continent in high school or grade school? To what extent do you think the authors of the textbook bring a western perspective to the study of African history?

Comparison (large or small group). “Maya writing.”

Distribute or project an example of Maya glyphs (writing), and ask students to compare it to the ancient writing systems already introduced in Chapter 2. Some questions to ask are:

   •   How would you rank Maya glyphs, on a scale of “difficult” to “easy,” compared to systems like hieroglyphs or cuneiform?
   •   What does the nature of the writing (complex pictographs and symbols representing syllables) suggest to you about who in society would have been able to write?

Map analysis (large or small group). “Establishing African civilizations.”
Display a physical map of Africa. Ask students:

   •   to identify the location of the major African civilizations covered in this chapter
   •   to discuss the question of why these civilizations developed where they did, taking into account the physical characteristics of the African landscape

Role-playing exercise (large or small group). “Indian merchants and the African trade.”

You are a merchant from the western coast of India at the time of the Gupta Empire. You are planning a voyage to trade along the eastern coast of Africa. Imagine your way into the challenges involved. You might divide the class into groups and ask students within each group to research:

   •   the role of monsoons in the Indian Ocean trade
   •   the sort of goods that would be traded
   •   what the Indian merchant would encounter in East Africa
