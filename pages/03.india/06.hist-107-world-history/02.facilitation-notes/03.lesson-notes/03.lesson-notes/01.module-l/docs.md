## Unit 1: Beginnings in History, to 600 BCE


**Unit 1 Topic 1**


**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are classroom activities to help students understand topic 1:

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade.

**Map analysis (large or small group). “Tracing human migrations.”**

Using either a modern physical map or a map shows the extent of [the last ice age](https://iceagenow.info/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Glacial_Maximum_World_Map-1.jpg), ask students to trace out the probable lines of human migration from Africa. Emphasize the role of land bridges and where they lay during the Ice Age. **[link to Outline maps - pdfs in google docs]**

**Comparison (large or small group). “Daily life in the Paleolithic and
Neolithic eras.”**

Divide the students into four groups, and ask each group to make an outline of
the daily life of one of the following:

-   a Paleolithic woman
-   a Paleolithic man
-   a Neolithic (sedentary) woman
-   a Neolithic (sedentary) man

Then bring the groups together and ask the class to discuss essential similarities and differences.

Note to facilitator: The key reference to guide this discussion is Ch. 1 of the assigned textbook.

**Role-playing exercise (small group). “How to domesticate a plant.”**

You are gatherers and hunters, thinking that there has to be an easier way of getting food than wandering around looking for plants. There’s a great bulbous tuber that you like to eat; how would you go about making it grow where you want it, when you want it?

**Unit 1 Topic 2**
==================

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are classroom activities to help students understand chapter 2:

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. (Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each time). The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [[participation grade rubric]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jqCKdi3OO8wiCyFMsxmLxgbInkelr4jnULKpu9jIDwc/edit)

**Map analysis (large or small group).**

Using a physical map of the world, ask students to identify the location of the main civilizations discussed in this chapter. Then encourage the students to make lists of

>   • physical conditions (mountains, oceans, deserts, and so on) that would simplify or hinder contact with other regions

>   • similarities (longitude, river valleys, etc.) and differences (relative size, etc.) between the geographic settings of the First Civilizations

**Role-playing exercise (small group).**

You and your family have just migrated from an agricultural, nomadic, or chiefdom society to one of the newly established cities of Sumer.

>   • How would your life change?

>   • What would stay the same?

>   • How would your gender impact your experience?

>   • Would your experience be different if you had migrated to Egypt? The Indus Valley? China?

**Study skills exercise (large or small group). “A roadmap of world history.”**

Most students are unimaginative when it comes to studying, often resorting to rote memorization. For this classroom activity, we suggest that you map out, with the class, two possible ways to study by association rather than by rote: the timeline and the thematic outline. We will return to this as a form of review in the Learning Lab for Unit 4, but it is helpful to introduce these concepts now, even though the students will not be equipped to participate fully at this point.

>   • For the timeline, you will need a large chalkboard or equivalent. Draw four very long horizontal lines, labeling them “Asia,” “Europe,” “Africa,” and “The Americas.” Mark off centuries with short vertical lines. Then ask the class to suggest items to add to the list. Encourage students to participate—for example, by asking other students to provide the time when a particular student has named an event. Ask leading questions to fill in gaps, with an eye toward cultural and religious events as well as political ones. At this point students will most likely simply focus on the early societies covered in this text.

>   • Explain to students the basic concept of memory by association, such as when they make an outline of points relating to a major theme and then study the points as a whole. Then, with the class, make a list of the course’s  major themes to date. Offer suggestions for the sorts of points that might be included under each theme. Finally, choose a single theme and sketch out a more detailed outline, soliciting as much input as possible from the students.
