Chapter description.
Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the classroom. This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next class. In class, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.
