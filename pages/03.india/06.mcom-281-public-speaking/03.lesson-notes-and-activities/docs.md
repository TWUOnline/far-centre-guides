Facilitators are vital to this course. As flipped education, this course involves both online and in-class components. Facilitators play a key role becasaue they interact with the students and can determine who is and who is not understanding material or having a good experience. Facilatators have latitude to focus on certain activities that they think are important at the moment. For example, the Facilitator might or might not want to have students volunteer to share what they wrote in their journal for a given activity. 

The following page outlines the Units, the online activities students will participate in, and some notes for in class activities.  Be sure to read through the online material in Moodle to help guide students, facilitate activities, and answer questions.

### In Class Activities:
For some of the activities above, students are asked to write their thoughts in a journal. Consider having students share with a partner, group or whole class, depending on the questions presented.  E.g. 
Activity 2.1: Share with a partner why you think listening is important.
Activity 2.5: Share what it means to be an ethical public speaker and why it is important. Consider also how ethical speaking can help you and your society. 

Activity 2.6: Plagiarism
Put the students in groups and ask them to answer the following question and share their responses with their classmates.
Which of these speech topics is ethical and which are not and why:
•	“How to Hack Computers.” 
•	“How to protect against hacking.”
•	“Why Getting Proper Sleep is Important for University Students.” 
•	“Practical Tips for Fruitful Dating.” 
•	“How to download Hollywood Movies for Free.” 
•	“How to Take Revenge on Someone Who Has Hurt You.”
•	“How to Find and Pay for Informative Speeches on the Internet.” 

Next, ask students to come up with three ethical and three unethical speech topics and decide why they are so. Ask them to present one to their classmates for student debate and discussion.
