Facilitators are vital to this course. As flipped education, this course involves both online and in-class components. Facilitators play a key role becasaue they interact with the students and can determine who is and who is not understanding material or having a good experience. Facilatators have latitude to focus on certain activities that they think are important at the moment. For example, the Facilitator might or might not want to have students volunteer to share what they wrote in their journal for a given activity. 

The following are specific notes from the instructor about the units.  Be sure to go to the Moodle site and review each unit in detail.  You may want to ask students to complete certain activities before each class so they are prepared to participate.


For many of the activities in the online units, students are asked to write
their thoughts in a journal. Consider having students share with a partner,
group or whole class, depending on the questions presented. E.g. Share with a
partner why you think public speaking is important.

### Unit 1

-   The following exercises can help the students to overcome speech anxiety and
    gain confidence in their ability to speak in front of others. It will also
    help you and them to get to know your classmates.

-   Everyone individually come to the front of the class and give a short
    impromptu speech (one that is made up and delivered with no preparation).
    E.g., tell the class your name, your favorite things to do, and your
    favorite music and food and why. This should take one to two minutes.

-   After each classmate finishes introducing his or her self the whole class
    will clap, cheer, stomp their feet, and shout phrases like the following:
    well done, bravo, loved it, etc. as a way to encourage the speaker.

-   Optional: Form into groups of three or four and have a webquest competition
    to see which group can find on the Internet the best tips and techniques for
    overcoming shyness, nervousness, speech anxiety, etc. You will have five
    minutes to do this and one person from each group will report on their
    peer’s findings and the class will vote on the group that found the most
    helpful strategies.

### Unit 2

-   Emphasize Topic 3: How to Improve Listening Skills

-   Taking notes on what is being said can aid the listening process. But don’t
    try to take down every word. Listening too hard by writing down every small
    detail can prevent us from absorbing the larger message. This is why we
    should focus on the main ideas and their supporting evidence.

-   Later in the course you will be given the opportunity to evaluate your class
    members’ speeches. When it is time to do so come back to this section and
    review it.

-   We must not allow our emotions make us rush to judgement that what is being
    said is all good or all bad. Snap conclusions are a sure way to short
    circuit the listening and understanding process.

-   Activity 2.6: Share what it means to be an ethical public speaker and why it
    is important. Consider also how ethical speaking can help you and your
    society.

-   Activity 2.7: Plagiarism: Put the students in groups and ask them to answer
    the following question and share their responses with their classmates.

    -   Which of these speech topics is ethical and which are not and why:

>   \- “How to Hack Computers.”

>   \- “How to protect against hacking.”

>   \- “Why Getting Proper Sleep is Important for University Students.”

>   \- “Practical Tips for Fruitful Dating.”

>   \- “How to download Hollywood Movies for Free.”

>   \- “How to Take Revenge on Someone Who Has Hurt You.”

>   \- “How to Find and Pay for Informative Speeches on the Internet.”

-   Next, ask students to come up with three ethical and three unethical speech
    topics and decide why they are so. Ask them to present one to their
    classmates for student debate and discussion.

### Unit 3:

-   Let students know what day they will deliver their Ice-Breaker speeches. You
    will choose the order of who will go first, second, third, etc.

-   Before the speeches, go over the guidelines for audience participation and
    reactions. Participation includes active listening skills and no
    distractions. Reactions include clapping, stomping the floor, shouting out
    praise such as great job, congratulations you did it, you wowed us, etc.
    Encourage students to try out these types of praise, even if they’re not
    comfortable doing so.

-   As noted, the goal is to make this first speech a memorable positive
    experience – for both the speaker and the audience.

-   Let students know after the Ice-Breaker speech that there will be an awards
    ceremony at the end of the course. Refer to the award list and ask students
    to make a note in their journals after each speech in the unit as to who
    should be nominated for an award.

### Unit 4

-   Suggested time two 75 min. classes

-   Point out Topic 3: Techniques for Using Language Effectively

    -   Use appropriate language. Swearing, cursing, and profane and obscene
        language are not proper for a public speech unless they are vital to the
        topic or are used to illustrate a point. Many people are offended by
        such language and you can turn them off and harm your credibility if you
        use such language when it is not called for. The same can be said for
        sexist language and racial and ethnic slurs. Some language is so
        powerful and defaming that you will instantly lose your audience when
        you use it. Your particular cultural and ethnic context will also
        determine this, something that you can discuss with your Facilitator.

-   Tongue-twisters: Have an in-class competition to see who can say all of
    these clearly without a single mistake

-   Articulation and Enunciation Exercises: Have volunteers stand before the
    class and do some of them out loud. Make this fun. It is not a time to judge
    but a time to grow together.

### Unit 5

-   Suggested time two 75 min. classes

-   Go over the Interviewing Guidelines document with students.

### Unit 6

-   Prepare students for speeches starting next week. Go over guidelines.
    Specifics about demonstrations speeches will be in Unit 7.

### Unit 7

-   This class will take 2-3 weeks, depending on your term schedule.

-   Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
    of students and term schedule)

-   Each presentation is …minutes long, with …for peer feedback, so plan classes
    accordingly] WE WILL HAVE TO DETERMINE HOW LONG EACH SPEECH WILL BE AND THE
    CLASS LENGTH TO DETERMINE WHO MANY COURSE DAYS THIS UNIT AND THREE TO FOLLOW
    WILL TAKE. UNIT 10 SHOULD BE ONE CLASS DAY.

-   Activity 7.1: Ask students to share their differences with a peer

-   Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
    after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.

### Unit 8

-   Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
    of students and term schedule)

-   This can be important activity to cover in class:

#### Activity 8.1: Comparing and Contrasting Demonstration and Informative Speeches 

Reflect on what you learned from your demonstration speech (the good and the
bad) and how that experience can help you create and deliver a strong
informative speech. Be prepared to share your thoughts with your Facilitator and
classmates.

-   Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
    after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.

### Unit 9

-   Confirm the time limit for the speech (e.g. 6-7 minutes, depending on number
    of students and term schedule)

-   Refer to the award list and ask students to make a note in their journals
    after each speech of this unit as to who should be nominated for an award.

-   Ask students to send their list of who deserves which award to the
    Facilitator and Instructor by the end of Unit 9.

    -   After each speech, students should have written in their journals who
        the best speeches were given by. Before they vote online, ask them to
        review their notes.

-   We will also need to decide what the reward will look like: certificate,
    plaque, statute, trophy, etc. If we are going to hand out something
    substantial like a plaque, statute, trophy then these awards should be
    mentioned in Unit 1 to help motivate students. What say, ye?
