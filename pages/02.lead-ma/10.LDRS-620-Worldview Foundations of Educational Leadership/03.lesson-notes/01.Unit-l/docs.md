# Unit 1: Worldview Formation and Development

In this first unit, students begin the course by analyzing the term “worldview” through considering how a worldview is formed, what questions a worldview answers, and how one’s worldview influences their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviours. Students will get to know their colleagues through engaging in vibrant discussions about how worldview is influenced by social, cultural, and/or religious backgrounds. Students will consider how what we love influences what we prioritize in life. Throughout this unit, students are encouraged to reflect on how your worldview influences your leadership decision making in your vocational setting.

Note: This course has been designed for students to complete unit learning activities at home prior to attending learning lab sessions; however, students may not arrive at the first session prepared for group discussions. Please allow time for students to work on learning activities in class, then clarify that all future learning activities need to be completed at home in preparation for learning lab group discussions.

#### Topic 1: Influences on Worldview Formation

Show the virtual photo tour and lead a discussion on how worldview affects perspective.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.2: Personal Worldview Questionnaire

Use the Activity 1.2 questions for a class activity. State a question and have students walk to a designated point in the room to indicate their opinion. e.g. “View of human nature: People are generally good” - if someone strongly agrees, they will stand on the west wall; if they strongly disagree, they will stand on the east wall; if they are somewhere in the middle, they will stand in the middle of the room. Allow time for respectful discussion after each question.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.3: Personal Worldview Statement

Please encourage students to complete this learning activity, as it will serve as the foundation for Assessment 5.1. Follow up with any students who may be struggling. There will be a variety of student aptitude and experience with expressing their thoughts succinctly in video format. Use class time for students to share their personal worldview statements, receive peer feedback, and fine tune their statements before posting online. Students may post more than once if desired. If Flipgrid is not available, students can record their video and upload it to Moodle or Microsoft Stream. Another alternative is to do a voice recording or audio podcast.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.4: Key Terms in Worldview Formation

Use the matching activity as a group discussion prompt.

#### Assignment 1.1: Discussion and Participation

Students should answer the listed questions using prose, video, audio, slide deck with narration and/or speakers notes, or any other creative method. They will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 1 Forum Discussion in Moodle. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
