# Unit 3: Connecting Self Knowledge, Personality Traits, and Educational Leadership  

Transformational servant leadership is rooted in the concept of serving others before self, modelled after the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. However, students must gain a deep understanding of themselves as leaders and learn who their followers are before they can begin the work of serving them. What are their beliefs and values? What motivates their actions? What kind of support do they need to thrive and grow? And how does each student answer all these questions for themselves? In Unit 3, students will investigate ways to engage in the process of knowing themselves, discovering personal strengths and shadows while exploring practical ways to get to know their followers as they aim to serve them in their vocational settings.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.3: From Shadow to Light

The topic of shadow lends itself to opportunities for vulnerable, honest conversation. Set up a safe discussion environment where participants feel confident in sharing their struggles. It may be helpful to set up some ground rules before starting discussion (e.g. “We will not share information outside of this room”). Acknowledge and affirm each participant through listening empathetically and without judgment.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.4: Reviewing Your Birkman Assessment

The Birkman Assessment section titles may change when the assessment is upgraded. If participants have a difficult time finding the listed sections, please direct them to look at the beginning of their report under the “Life Style Grid” heading.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.6: The Importance of Building Relationships***

This topic lends itself well to whole group discussion, where participants can share their newfound knowledge of personal strengths and weaknesses. Encourage dialogue where participants build empathy skills through listening and understanding the perspectives of others.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.8: Case Study  
Use the case study as an opportunity for group discussion.

### Assignment 3.1: Case Study Discussion and Participation

Before discussing the case study, students should share the following information in small groups:

  - Shadow(s) and light(s)

  - Birkman colour

  - Results of personality assessments (Enneagram, NERIS Type Explorer, The Big Five Aspects Scale, and/or CliftonStrengths)

Students will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 3 Forum Discussion in Moodle using the Assignment 3.1 criteria listed in Moodle. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
