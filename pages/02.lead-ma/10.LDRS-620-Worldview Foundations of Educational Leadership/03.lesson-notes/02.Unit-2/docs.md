# Unit 2: Principles of Christian Worldview and Transformational Servant Leadership Theory  

In the second unit of LDRS 620, we will examine principles of Christian worldview and transformational servant leadership theory. Each of these complex topics have enough discussion and research elements for entire courses separately, so we will do a broad overview of foundational understandings and influential ideologies from each area. Students in this course will have a wide variety of previous knowledge and experience with Christianity and transformational servant leadership, so you are encouraged to listen closely and share generously as we learn with and from each other in this collaborative environment. As you progress through the readings, learning activities, and assignments, reflect on how the ideas and theories align with your own worldview and background and how you might make changes to your personal philosophy of leadership based on new understandings.

#### Activity 2.1: Christianity as the One True Worldview

Not all participants may be Christians in this course. Invite respectful debate around this topic where necessary, and actively monitor class climate and emotional levels during and after discussion. Emphasize the importance of developing the transformational servant leadership skills of empathy and others-focused communication.

#### Activity 2.2: Leader Interview

If participants struggle to find a leader to interview, encourage them to complete one of the mentioned alternatives.

#### Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 2.3: Case Study - Southwest Airlines

Show the following 5.5 minute video: [<span class="underline">How Southwest Airlines Built Its Culture</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_CeFiUkV7s) (Herb Kelleher | Founder, Southwest Airlines)

Lead a group discussion using the “Questions to Consider” from Moodle. Depending on your location, transformational servant leadership principles may be new concepts for participants. You have the freedom to take extra time to discuss these principles in more depth. Encourage participants to share knowledge and application from personal experience wherever possible.

### Assignment 2.1: Jigsaw Discussion and Participation

Please review the [<span class="underline">Jigsaw Method video</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euhtXUgBEts) in preparation for facilitating this activity. Students should come prepared with notes about their “expert group” topics to share during Round 1 of discussions. Substantive participation is encouraged. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.

Place students in expert groups before the session, and give them time to research and prepare for group discussion. After Round 1, place students in teaching groups so that one member of each expert group is represented in the new teaching groups. Students will summarize and disseminate information from Round 1 during Round 2.
