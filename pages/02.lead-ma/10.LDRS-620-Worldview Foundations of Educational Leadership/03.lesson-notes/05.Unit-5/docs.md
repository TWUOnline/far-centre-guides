# Unit 5: The Reflective Journey Towards Serving and Empowering Others

In this final unit of LDRS 620, students will examine the significance of moving from a self-centered leadership worldview to a Christ-like, others-centered posture. Students will explore ways of integrating Biblical leadership principles as they develop your awareness of being led by humility rather than a hunger for power. Students will learn from modern-day servant leaders, and consider practical ways to integrate new ideas into their leadership approaches. Finally, students will complete a self-assessment of personal leadership development thus far, and generate a plan for further growth.

#### Activity 5.2: Letting God Lead

Show the following 6.5 minute video:

  - [<span class="underline">Biblical Leadership Qualities</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jFrWmj1KSI) (Mia Rene | Christian entrepreneur and speaker)

Lead a group discussion using the list of Biblical leadership qualities from Moodle. If a student is unfamiliar with Biblical stories, they may share applicable stories from other contexts or personal experiences.

#### Topic 3: Past Experiences, Present Growth, Future Plans

As time allows, invite participants to share about their personal transformation journey with as many or few details as they feel comfortable. It may work best to split participants into smaller groups to facilitate a safer discussion environment.

#### Assignment 5.1: Personal Application and Participation

Students should complete Assignment 5.1 as listed in Moodle using prose, video, audio, slide deck with narration and/or speakers notes, or any other creative method. They will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 1 Forum Discussion in Moodle. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
