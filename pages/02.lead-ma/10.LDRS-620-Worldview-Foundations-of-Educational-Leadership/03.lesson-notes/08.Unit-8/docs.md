## Topic 1: Defining Diversity

#### Activity 7.1: Chain of Diversity (Lab activity)

In the Bible, it clearly states, “I am fearfully and wonderfully made” (Psalm 139:14). When I first read that scripture, I realized how truly unique I am. And guess what? You are unique, too. In this first activity, you will discover and recognize the many ways in which you are similar and different from each other, and as well how your uniqueness as an individual.

## Topic 2: Stereotyping

#### Activity 7.2: The Perception Game

**Perception Game (10 minutes)**

Begin the exercise be having [three] volunteers come to the front, facing the audience. Each is given one sheet of colored paper. You will then instruct them to follow your directions exactly as you say. Before you give the instructions, they must close their eyes.

Advise the students in the audience that no comments can be made on their behalf. And, laughing is allowed!

Have the [students], with eyes closed, hold their sheets of paper in front of them. Then instruct them to fold the paper in half; then in half again. They must then turn the paper x number of times to the right and left; each time tearing off a piece of paper in the corner. Repeat this three or four times and end by having the volunteers fold the sheet in half one more time and tearing off a piece in the middle. During this whole process, never say specifically which corner to tear.

With their eyes closed, ask them to unfold their sheet of paper while holding it in front of them. They may then open their eyes, only to discover that each design is totally different.

**Facilitator asks students answer Round Robin:**

1.  Why is each design totally different?

2.  Did they not have the same instructions?

3.  Didn’t they all follow those instructions?

4.  Then why do we have totally different pieces?

#### Activity 7:3: First Impressions (10 – 20 minutes)

In the next Activity; the Herman Grid, you will realize we often see something that does not exist.

**Facilitator:** Students are invited to share their examples of their scenarios with First Impressions. (see online instructions [here](https://diversity.missouristate.edu/academic-diversity-activity-first-impressions.htm)) Attach PDFs

#### Activity 7.4: Connect the Dots

In this exercise, students will experience the fact that we often subconsciously limit our perspectives and alternatives.

In the Connect the Dots activity you will do in your lab, you will be confronted with a problem to solve and will have to change your perspectives to solve it.

**Facilitator:** (see PDF for Connect the Dot instructions) Online instructions [here](https://diversity.missouristate.edu/academic-diversity-activities-nine-dots.htm).

#### Activity 7.5: Stereotyping

What is stereotyping?

**Facilitator** writes down student’s answers.

As a young child, I was told by my parents to stay away from Catholics. Growing up in Scotland, Catholic and Protestants often segregated themselves from each other. I would ride the public transit to school, and the Catholic children would sit at the back of the bus, and the Protestant children would sit at the front. We all knew who we were because of the school jackets we wore!

Believing Catholics were terrible people, stayed with me for many years until I finally realized stereotyping is an untrue belief and prejudice against others. I guess I missed many great opportunities to build lasting relationships merely because of stereotyping. As leaders, we must first recognize, stop judging and then correct the errors of our ways with regards to stereotyping.

Note for Facilitator

**Stereotyping**

In this next activity, students will recognize the widespread use of stereotypes. Students will engage writing on sheets of paper on the walls of the room “What they know or what they’ve heard about a particular group.”

“Each sheet of paper could be titled: Women, Men, Teenagers, African American Males, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, Catholics, Christians, Jews, Arabs, Moslems, Amish People, Wealthy People, Poor People, The Homeless, People on Welfare, People with a physical challenge, Californians, Southerners, People 75 years and older, People who live in the Country, People who live in the City, etc. At the end of the activity, students will discuss stereotypes. We often become conditioned to think about stereotypes on an almost automatic basis when we see or hear about someone whose background is different from our own. We all use stereotypes at one point or another. The important thing is that we begin to become more conscious of the fact that we are often thinking “on automatic.”

The goal at the end of this activity is to stop and ask if what we are thinking is a fact or a stereotype.

**Facilitator** (see PDF) Upon gathering up wall sheets, the Facilitator will choose students to read the sheets out loud. The facilitator will ask the following questions:

1.  What do many of the comments you have written on the lists represent?

2.  Are they all true?

3.  Where did they come from? (Responses might include parents, friends, teachers, books, the media, and others.)

## Topic 3: Diversity and Intercultural Competence (know-how)

#### Activity 7.6: Case Study

In your Learning Lab, you will participate in analyzing case studies, using the ideas presented in the text. Be sure to take notes and bring them to share with your peers.

To promote diversity, the facilitator will Use three different coloured candies (green, red, blue) to separate students into three groups. Each group will take a section of the Chapter:

**Group 1:** Read and report to the class main points on pages 222 – 227 of Chapter 9 writing down the key points on the board.

**Group 2**: Read and report to the class main points on pages 228 – 234 of Chapter 9 writing down the key points on the board.

**Group 3**: Read and report to the class main points on pages 234 – 240 of Chapter 9 writing down the key points on the board.

Next, groups will look at three Case Studies:

Group 1 Case Study 1

Group 2 Case Study 3

Group 3 Case Study 4

Groups will make a mini presentation on their findings.

## Assessment

**Assignment: Debate Assignment**

**Debate Teams and Topics**

**The class will be divided into debate teams, usually 3 students on each team. Two teams will debate. The instructor will provide a list of topic options and each team will defend their point of view.**

**For example:**

***Team 1 states*: “The most important characteristic of a good team is having a wide variety of backgrounds”.***

***Team 2 states*: “We believe that a wide variety of backgrounds is not the most important characteristic of a good team. We feel that being able to get along is the most important”.***

**See Assessment section for notes on Preparation for Debate**

**Facilitator:**
- Choose Debate Teams.
- Students will choose and submit their Topic.
- Topics to choose from are posted on Moodle.

**Assignment: Case Study Assignment**

**See Assessment for details**

Each team will be responsible to evaluate a case study by following the case study evaluation guidelines (How to Approach Case Studies) given below. The team will make a presentation to the class and will hand in a report of their evaluation. The approach to the case study should be based on the communication: persuasion and positive influence and the concepts that you have been learning in class.

Important points:

Presentation: The teams must be prepared to answer questions from the other teams. Each team must prepare 5 questions to ask the team presenting. Presentations will take place during the last 2 classes.

Report: The report must follow the APA guidelines (includes not plagiarizing)

1.  Each member of the team must state which topic they completed in the report.

2.  The entire report must be a cohesive compilation of all the writing done by the members of the team (for example, flow well from one point to another).

3.  Report should be between 4-5 pages.

4.  The report is due on the last day of class.

**Facilitator**

- Teams will be chosen for the Group Case Study Assignment.
- Students will choose their Case Study. These are posted on Moodle.
