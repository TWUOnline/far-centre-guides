# Lesson Notes for LDRS 620

The following pages provide key information for LDRS 620 units (schedules, activity instructions, etc). Please review the full course in Moodle and connect with the course instructor if you need clarification.

# Unit 1: Worldview Formation and Development

In this first unit, students begin the course by analyzing the term “worldview” through considering how a worldview is formed, what questions a worldview answers, and how one’s worldview influences their thoughts, beliefs, and behaviours. Students will get to know their colleagues through engaging in vibrant discussions about how worldview is influenced by social, cultural, and/or religious backgrounds. Students will consider how what we love influences what we prioritize in life. Throughout this unit, students are encouraged to reflect on how your worldview influences your leadership decision making in your vocational setting.

Note: This course has been designed for students to complete unit learning activities at home prior to attending learning lab sessions; however, students may not arrive at the first session prepared for group discussions. Please allow time for students to work on learning activities in class, then clarify that all future learning activities need to be completed at home in preparation for learning lab group discussions.

***Topic 1: Influences on Worldview Formation***

Show the virtual photo tour and lead a discussion on how worldview affects perspective.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.2: Personal Worldview Questionnaire***

Use the Activity 1.2 questions for a class activity. State a question and have students walk to a designated point in the room to indicate their opinion. e.g. “View of human nature: People are generally good” - if someone strongly agrees, they will stand on the west wall; if they strongly disagree, they will stand on the east wall; if they are somewhere in the middle, they will stand in the middle of the room. Allow time for respectful discussion after each question.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.3: Personal Worldview Statement***

Please encourage students to complete this learning activity, as it will serve as the foundation for Assessment 5.1. Follow up with any students who may be struggling. There will be a variety of student aptitude and experience with expressing their thoughts succinctly in video format. Use class time for students to share their personal worldview statements, receive peer feedback, and fine tune their statements before posting online. Students may post more than once if desired. If Flipgrid is not available, students can record their video and upload it to Moodle or Microsoft Stream. Another alternative is to do a voice recording or audio podcast.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 1.4: Key Terms in Worldview Formation***

Use the matching activity as a group discussion prompt.

***Assignment 1.1: Discussion and Participation***

Students should answer the listed questions using prose, video, audio, slide deck with narration and/or speakers notes, or any other creative method. They will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 1 Forum Discussion in Moodle. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.

***Assignment 1.2: Unit Reflective Paper***

After the learning lab is done, remind students they need to work on their unit assignment at home. See Moodle for a full explanation of what is expected, including a rubric for assessment, and walk students through the assignment description and success criteria.

# Unit 2: Principles of Christian Worldview and Transformational Servant Leadership Theory  

In the second unit of LDRS 620, we will examine principles of Christian worldview and transformational servant leadership theory. Each of these complex topics have enough discussion and research elements for entire courses separately, so we will do a broad overview of foundational understandings and influential ideologies from each area. Students in this course will have a wide variety of previous knowledge and experience with Christianity and transformational servant leadership, so you are encouraged to listen closely and share generously as we learn with and from each other in this collaborative environment. As you progress through the readings, learning activities, and assignments, reflect on how the ideas and theories align with your own worldview and background and how you might make changes to your personal philosophy of leadership based on new understandings.

#### **Activity 2.1: Christianity as the One True Worldview**

Not all participants may be Christians in this course. Invite respectful debate around this topic where necessary, and actively monitor class climate and emotional levels during and after discussion. Emphasize the importance of developing the transformational servant leadership skills of empathy and others-focused communication.

#### **Activity 2.2: Leader Interview**

If participants struggle to find a leader to interview, encourage them to complete one of the mentioned alternatives.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 2.3: Case Study - Southwest Airlines***

Show the following 5.5 minute video: [<span class="underline">How Southwest Airlines Built Its Culture</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_CeFiUkV7s) (Herb Kelleher | Founder, Southwest Airlines)

Lead a group discussion using the “Questions to Consider” from Moodle. Depending on your location, transformational servant leadership principles may be new concepts for participants. You have the freedom to take extra time to discuss these principles in more depth. Encourage participants to share knowledge and application from personal experience wherever possible.

***Assignment 2.1: Jigsaw Discussion and Participation***

Please review the [<span class="underline">Jigsaw Method video</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=euhtXUgBEts) in preparation for facilitating this activity. Students should come prepared with notes about their “expert group” topics to share during Round 1 of discussions. Substantive participation is encouraged. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.

Place students in expert groups before the session, and give them time to research and prepare for group discussion. After Round 1, place students in teaching groups so that one member of each expert group is represented in the new teaching groups. Students will summarize and disseminate information from Round 1 during Round 2.

***Assignment 2.2: Reflection and Application Project***

After the learning lab is done, remind students they need to work on their unit assignment at home. See Moodle for a full explanation of what is expected, including a rubric for assessment, and walk students through the assignment description and success criteria.

# Unit 3: Connecting Self Knowledge, Personality Traits, and Educational Leadership  
  
Transformational servant leadership is rooted in the concept of serving others before self, modelled after the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. However, students must gain a deep understanding of themselves as leaders and learn who their followers are before they can begin the work of serving them. What are their beliefs and values? What motivates their actions? What kind of support do they need to thrive and grow? And how does each student answer all these questions for themselves? In Unit 3, students will investigate ways to engage in the process of knowing themselves, discovering personal strengths and shadows while exploring practical ways to get to know their followers as they aim to serve them in their vocational settings.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.3: From Shadow to Light***

The topic of shadow lends itself to opportunities for vulnerable, honest conversation. Set up a safe discussion environment where participants feel confident in sharing their struggles. It may be helpful to set up some ground rules before starting discussion (e.g. “We will not share information outside of this room”). Acknowledge and affirm each participant through listening empathetically and without judgment.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.4: Reviewing Your Birkman Assessment***

The Birkman Assessment section titles may change when the assessment is upgraded. If participants have a difficult time finding the listed sections, please direct them to look at the beginning of their report under the “Life Style Grid” heading.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.6: The Importance of Building Relationships***

This topic lends itself well to whole group discussion, where participants can share their newfound knowledge of personal strengths and weaknesses. Encourage dialogue where participants build empathy skills through listening and understanding the perspectives of others.

***Facilitated Learning Lab Activity 3.8: Case Study  
***  
Use the case study as an opportunity for group discussion.

### ***Assignment 3.1: Case Study Discussion and Participation***

Before discussing the case study, students should share the following information in small groups:

  - Shadow(s) and light(s)

  - Birkman colour

  - Results of personality assessments (Enneagram, NERIS Type Explorer, The Big Five Aspects Scale, and/or CliftonStrengths)

Students will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 3 Forum Discussion in Moodle using the Assignment 3.1 criteria listed in Moodle. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.

# Unit 4: Personal Biases, Indigenous Gifts, and Educational Leadership

Each person has a unique perspective of the world, based on beliefs, values, and experiences. This worldview influences thoughts, behaviours, and decision making, and over the past three units students have explored the importance of knowing personal worldview and uncovering your own strengths and shadows. In Unit 4, students will analyze how hidden personal biases affect how they treat others, and apply this knowledge to the history of Canadian Indigenous groups and Indigenous groups from the students’ own culture. Through learning from primary sources, students will examine the role of Indigineous ways of knowing in educational leadership, and consider ways of applying Indigenous gifts in their current leadership context.

Note: Before starting this unit, please take the time to have a class discussion about the definition of “Indigenous,” and any localized cultural terms for Indigenous people groups in your context (e.g. First Nations). This will help students create a common definition of terms used throughout this unit.

#### **Activity 4.4: Interviews on the Role of Indigineous Gifts in Cultural Formation and Educational Leadership  
**

This is an in-depth learning activity with a substantive amount of material. Feel free to adjust time allotted for this activity based on student learning needs. For example, you may wish to allow more time for longer discussion, or shorten the activity by assigning a portion of the interview clips or fewer reflection questions. You may need to use another collaborative whiteboard, such as Etherpad, a collaborative Google Doc, or a Forum 4 discussion in Moodle.

#### **Topic 3: The Role of Traditional Indigenous Worldviews in Educational Leadership**

This topic uses Canadian residential schools as an example of how Indigenous worldview can be integrated with educational leadership. Invite participants to give examples from their own cultural contexts to deepen discussion and create opportunities for personal application.

#### **Activity 4.6: First Peoples Principles of Learning  
**

Students may not be able to complete the entire table. Encourage students to use this activity to deepen their understanding of how Indigenous gifts can enhance existing practices and uncover hidden biases. Students may complete this activity in a personal Word document or a collaborative Google Doc.

### ***Assignment 4.1: Personal Application and Participation***

Allow time for students to discuss their reflections with colleagues during in-class discussion opportunities. After completing in-class discussion activities, students should post notes and a summarizing paragraph of what they learned during the discussion activities in a Unit 4 Forum Discussion in Moodle. Students can represent their ideas in forums using prose, video, audio, slide deck with narration and/or speakers notes, or any other creative method of choice. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.

# Unit 5: The Reflective Journey Towards Serving and Empowering Others

In this final unit of LDRS 620, students will examine the significance of moving from a self-centered leadership worldview to a Christ-like, others-centered posture. Students will explore ways of integrating Biblical leadership principles as they develop your awareness of being led by humility rather than a hunger for power. Students will learn from modern-day servant leaders, and consider practical ways to integrate new ideas into their leadership approaches. Finally, students will complete a self-assessment of personal leadership development thus far, and generate a plan for further growth.

***Activity 5.2: Letting God Lead***

Show the following 6.5 minute video:

  - [<span class="underline">Biblical Leadership Qualities</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jFrWmj1KSI) (Mia Rene | Christian entrepreneur and speaker)

Lead a group discussion using the list of Biblical leadership qualities from Moodle. If a student is unfamiliar with Biblical stories, they may share applicable stories from other contexts or personal experiences.

***Topic 3: Past Experiences, Present Growth, Future Plans***

As time allows, invite participants to share about their personal transformation journey with as many or few details as they feel comfortable. It may work best to split participants into smaller groups to facilitate a safer discussion environment.

***Assignment 5.1: Personal Application and Participation***

Students should complete Assignment 5.1 as listed in Moodle using prose, video, audio, slide deck with narration and/or speakers notes, or any other creative method. They will share ideas during in-class discussion/presentation and summarize their learning by posting in the Unit 1 Forum Discussion in Moodle. As the facilitator, please fill out a rubric for each student to let the instructor know about engagement and participation. This will be part of the student’s grade for this portion of the course.
