# Student Resources

When designing your activities your goal should be to enable students to be as successful as they can be. We want to give students meaningful opportunities to demonstrate
learning. 

### Barriers to Adult Learning 
There are barriers to adult learning that you should keep in mind as you plan your learning opportunities. There may be
undiagnosed learning disabilities, cross cultural differences and English language learning to be considered. 

>> #### Learning Disabilities

  - Refer students to the [Steps to attaining disability services at
    TWU](https://www.twu.ca/wellness-centre/disabilities-and-equity-access/steps-attaining-disability-services)

>> #### English Language Learning

  - Refer students to the [TWU Writing
    Centre](https://www.twu.ca/student-life/student-success/writing-centre)
