#### Topic 3: Process of Social Movement?

!! **Note to Facilitators:** Do [this classroom activity](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/2379298118796600) with the students.

The social and collective aspects of this unit are what students need to be focused on. How do individual beliefs and behaviours coalesce and turn into a group behaviour? Conversely, how do group behaviours influence individuals to behaviour differently than would have if they were alone?Â  Figure 16.1, Table 16.1, and Table 16.4 shown below provide ways of understanding the stages or development of a social movement.
