## Unit 2:  Culture


#### Topic 1:  What is Culture?

**Learning Activities -- Classroom Activity**

***Activity 2.2: Case Study***

***The following activity will be in a hidden forum/page so students will only be able to view the case study in the lab.***

Read the case study below of the sacred "Rac" in class in small groups and work through the discussion questions. Be prepared to support your answers with the reasons behind your answers.

**The Sacred "Rac"**

An Indian anthropologist, Chandra Thapar, made a study of foreign cultures with customs similar to those of his native land. One culture in particular fascinated him because it revered one animal as sacred -- much as the people in India revere the cow. The things that he discovered might interest you.

The tribe Dr. Thapar studied is called the Asu and is found on the American continent to the north of the Terahmare of Mexico. Though the Asu seem to be a highly developed society in some ways, they are overwhelmingly preoccupied with the care and feeding of the rac -- an animal much like the bull in size, strength, and temperament. In the Asu tribe, it is almost a social obligation to own at least one rac.

Anyone who owns none is held in low esteem by the community because he is too poor to maintain one of these beasts properly. To display their wealth and social prestige, some members of the tribe even own herds of rac.

Unfortunately, the rac breed is not very healthy, and individual animals generally do not live more than 5-7 years. Each family invests large sums of money each year to keep its rac healthy and shod, for it has a tendency to throw its shoes often. There are rac specialists in each community -- perhaps more than one if the community is particularly wealthy. These specialists, however, due to the long period of ritual training they must undergo and due to the difficulty of obtaining the right selection of charms to treat the rac, demand costly offerings whenever a tribesman must treat his ailing rac.

At the age of 16, young men in many Asu communities generally undergo a puberty rite in which the rac figures prominently. The youth must petition a high priest in a grand temple. He is then initiated into the ceremonies that surround the care of the rac and is permitted to keep the rac.

Although the rac may be used as a beast of burden, it has many habits which other cultures would consider detrimental to the life of the society. In the first place, the rac breed is increasing at a very rapid rate and the Asu tribesmen have given no thought to curbing the rac population. As a consequence, the Asu must build more and more paths and fields for the rac to travel on, since its delicate health and its love for racing other rac at high speeds necessitates that special areas be set aside for its use. The cost of smoothing the earth is too costly for one individual to undertake; thus it has become a community project, and each tribesman must pay an annual tithe to build new paths and maintain the old. There are so many paths needed that some people must move their homes because the rac paths must be as straight as possible to keep any animal from injuring itself. Dr. Thapar also noted that, unlike the excrement of a cow (which many in his country hold sacred), that of the rac cannot be used as either fuel or fertilizer. On the contrary, rac excrement is exceptionally foul and totally useless. Worst of all, the rac is prone to rampages in which it runs down anything in its path, much like stampeding cattle. Estimates are that the rac kill thousands of Asu in a year. Despite the high cost of its upkeep, the damage it does to the land, and its penchant for destructive rampages, the Asu still regard the rac as essential to the survival of their culture.

A member of the "panchayat" (or village council) in Chandra Thapar's home village, has had some experience with the Planned Parenthood campaign in rural India. He suggests that the only rational thing for the Asu to do is to begin a program of birth control for the rac. He thinks his village should send a technical assistance team to advise the Asu on limiting the rac population. He feels that comparing the rac with the so-called sacred cow of India is inappropriate since the cow contributes so much more to Indian life while the rac kills, maims and upsets the life and environment of the Asu.

**Questions for Discussion:**

1. Would you want to own a sacred rac in order to acquire social status?

2. How would you evaluate the intellectual capabilities of the Asu?

3. If the Asu had a democratic form of government and were able to legislate positive changes --

what would you recommend?

!! **Note for Facilitator:**
!! After everyone has read the study, be prepared to lead the class in a discussion of the power of ethnocentrism in the shaping of the way we view cultures that are different than ours.

#### Topic 3:  Subculture and Counterculture

***Activity 2.5: Countercultural Music***

**Questions to Consider:**

After completing the activities above, answer the following questions:

- Consider the music genre of Indie music. This is a genre of music that is meant to be produced independently of big commercial music companies. As a result, it can be considered countercultural. Consider what happens when Indie music becomes so popular that most people start listening to it, music stations are dedicated to it and recording companies start to finance it?

(Note that you may be asked to share your thoughts with your peers in the Facilitated Learning Lab.)

#### Topic 5:  Science, Technology, and Cultural Change

**Instructor Led Activity**

***Activity 2.7: High vs. Pop Culture***

Work through the following [case study](https://oup-arc.com/access/content/quanhaasetepperman-1e-student-resources/chapter-03-case-study?previousFilter=tag_case-studies) in class with groups of 2 or 3 other students. Use the major theories presented in the chapter to guide you. Be prepared to present your answers to the rest of the class.

!!! **Chapter 03 Case Study**
!!!
!!! Tina works in marketing for a large post-secondary institution that is trying to recruit more international students from China. She travels to Beijing to meet with a government representative Yan who works with students wanting to study abroad. Before she leaves for China, Tina communicates with Yan several times over email. The email messages are professional and respectful. Yan writes very well in English.
!!!
!!! Tina has never been to China before and is looking forward to her two-week visit. Tina spends a lot of time making travel arrangements, preparing her materials, and even learning some Mandarin phrases.
!!!
!!! When she meets Yan at her office in Beijing, Yan is cold and distant, not smiling and not making eye contact even when Tina, smiling, greets her in Mandarin. When Tina shares her ideas, Yan nods, looks down and does not offer any input. Tina returns to her hotel, dejected, not sure what to do before tomorrow's meeting with Yan and her associates. Tina hopes that Yan will be more friendly and communicative.

**Questions to Consider**

After completing the activities above, answer the following questions:

- 1\. What should Tina do before the next meeting?

- 2\. How should Tina handle Yan's behaviour?

- 3\. Tina hopes that Yan will be more friendly and communicative. Are these reasonable expectations? Why or why not?

- 4\. What could Tina have done differently before travelling to China?

- 5\. What responsibility do companies and employees have when dealing with others from a different culture?

*Feel free to answer the questions in your notes or Reflective Learning Journal.*

*Note that the learning activities in this course are ungraded, unless specified.  They are designed to help you succeed in your assessments in this course, so you are strongly encouraged to complete them.*
