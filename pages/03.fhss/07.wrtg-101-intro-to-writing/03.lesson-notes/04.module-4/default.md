# Module 4: Definition Essay

**[NOTEs to the facilitator]: The First Day of the lab (Week 8-1)**

-   For this short announcement, do not spend more than 10 minutes. ….

-   Explain the Module 4 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of M4 Group
    Worksheet/Individual thesis, M4 in-class writing, and M4 final essay.

-   For your information, students should choose one term given in the M4
    Assignment (Instructions) page and post it to the forum page (Individual
    Activity 1.3) by the end of the lab on Week 8-1. Based on the choice of
    their term, the professor will group them for their M4 “Group” worksheet.

-   Emphasize that they will complete a “Group” worksheet with their group
    partner(s). However, they will write their thesis and entire essay based on
    the group worksheet “individually”. For more details, please read the
    instructions in Lab Activity 1.6 & 1.7.

-   Help students to find/read the M4 Definition Essay (Instructions) given on
    Module 4 page in Moodle:

    1.  M4 Definition Essay Assignment (Instructions)

-   M4 Worksheet template and example files are given in Lab Activity 1.6.

    1.  M4 Worksheet (Template)

    2.  M4 Worksheet (Example): (This hidden link will be open to students in
        Week 6-2.)

-   M4 In-Class Writing template: (Make this hidden file visible to students at
    the beginning of the LAST lab (Week 10-2) before they turn off the wifi.)

-   **IMPORTANT**: All the essays should be submitted by the last day of the
    semester. IF there are some students who haven’t submitted their previous
    essays, please remind them of this important information. Also, those who
    have been advised to rewrite one of their essays from the professor
    individually should submit the rewritten essay by the last day of the
    semester. That is, the submission after the last day of the semester is NOT
    allowed.

*The information below is the ones that you already mentioned in Module 1\~3.
However, as a reminder, please inform the information below again “in short” if
necessary:*

-   There is also an M4- ongoing Dropbox where they can save their essay drafts
    up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their essay, they need to save their
    files such as “M4 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M4 draft 2 (Your name)”.

-   The M4 final essay Dropbox (Turnitin) will be automatically closed at the
    due time, so encourage students to submit their file on time. When they
    mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the professor) can
    delete the wrong file for them and give them a second chance to resubmit it
    “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes their wrong file, please send
    the list of students who resubmitted their essay to the professor by email.

-   If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent issue
    related to “family or severe sickness”, they should communicate with the
    professor promptly by email. In terms of sickness, they will need to provide
    the professor with an official medical report.

-   Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will result in
    the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at the end of the
    semester.

-   When they email the professor, they should indicate their official (and
    English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will probably
    have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to indicate their
    identification clearly.

#### Individual Activity 1.2 [Topic 1: Identifying definitions & Topic 2: Thinking Stage]

**WATCH this TED-Ed video**. This video defines one abstract term “Love”. While
watching this video, write down ALL the meanings of love that the speaker
mentions in the video. After taking notes, take some more time to complete 4
multiple choices and 3 open-ended questions given on the same website. You can
review this activity as many times as you would like.

-   TEDEd Video: [What is love? - Brad
    Troeger](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-love-brad-troeger#watch) (5
    minutes)

-   [7 Questions](https://ed.ted.com/lessons/what-is-love-brad-troeger#review)
    on the video- What is love?

**[NOTE]:** Please keep your notes on this video. You will use the notes in
Topic 2.

**[NOTEs to the facilitator]:**

-   Check if students have finished this individual activity or not. If they
    hadn’t completed this activity, please watch the video together and ask them
    to take notes while watching the video. They can complete the 7 questions
    individually after the lab.

#### Individual Activity 1.3 [Topic 1 & Topic 2] forum activity

**By the end of the FIRST lab of Module 4, Choose ONE term for your essay from
the topic list given on the M4 assignment instructions page**. Post the topic
that you’ve chosen for your definition essay to the forum page. This will help
your professor to choose your partner(s) to complete your M4 group worksheet. If
you forgot to post your topic by the end of the first lab of Module 4, your
professor will choose your topic, so don’t forget to post your topic on time.

**[NOTEs to the facilitator]:**

-   Make sure that ALL students have posted the choice of their topic to the
    forum page before they leave the lab.

**Lab Activity 1.5 [Topic 2- Brainstorming]:** (With your partner(s)) *– Forum
page hidden view for students*

**[Instructions]:**

1.  Check the forum page of the Individual Activity 1.3. Your professor has
    posted the name of your partner(s) on the forum page.

2.  With your partner(s), you will start brainstorming the term that you have
    chosen to write your definition essay.

    For example, organize all the possible meanings of your term from 2\~3
    perspectives in the chart below. (*For this, you may want to search “the
    meaning of (your term)” or “the meaning of (your term) in the Bible” online.
    Please do some basic research with your partner:* [Google Advance
    Search](https://www.google.ca/advanced_search))

| Perspectives              | Meanings of a term |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| Psychological perspective |                    |
| Sociological perspective  |                    |
| Religious perspective     |                    |

3.  Discuss/decide what perspective can be suitable for your essay with your
    partner(s) based on your findings.

4.  Highlight the selection of your perspective in yellow, and then POST the
    chart to the forum page by the end of the lab.

**[NOTE for the facilitator]:**

-   Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation mark.

-   Please use the excel file that I have given you in Module 1 in order to
    record each student’s effort to work on their group worksheet ranged from 5
    to 0. You will need to send the file to the professor by the end of the
    semester.

**Lab Activity 1.6 [Topic 3- Thinking Stage: M4 Group Worksheet]:** (With your
partners) *– “Group” Forum page hidden view for students*

**[Instructions]: This is an M4 group worksheet.**

1.  Based on the group brainstorming chart in Lab Activity 1.5, complete your M4
    Group Worksheet. Use the given worksheet template. Also, for your
    understanding check the M4 example worksheet before you start.

2.  This M4 group worksheet activity will take you approximately 3 hours to
    complete (check lab times with your facilitator). Please do research more on
    your term to complete this group worksheet properly.

-   All the individual activities that are graded in Module 1\~4 will be counted
    in a total of 3%.

-   The individual activities are to encourage you to study on a regular basis,
    so it does not matter how many correct answers you get. That is, whenever
    you complete each individual activity, you will receive a full mark, 5
    points. If not, you will be given ‘0’.

-   All the lab activities in Module 1\~4 will be counted in a total of 5%.

-   Your facilitator will monitor your contribution to each lab activity and
    give you a mark from 0 to 5. This will be reported to your professor.

-   Remember that the lab activities which are also formative are about your
    efforts, but not about the results of your group work. Please “participate”
    in each lab activity diligently.

### M4 Group Worksheet (5 points) + Individual thesis (5 points): 2%

-   Use M4 Group Worksheet (Template).

-   Refer to M4 Group Worksheet (Example).

-   Submit your M4 Group Worksheet to the designated Forum page as a group.

-   Submit your “individual” thesis to your individual wiki page.

-   **Deadline**: by the end of the lab on Week 10-1

-   Students will receive feedback from their professor within 2\~3 days.

### M4 In-class Writing: 5%

-   When: The LAST lab of Module 4 (Week 10-2).

-   Do NOT be late or absent on that day.

    -   Those who came late for the lab will not be given any extra time.

    -   Absentees will receive a “zero” grade automatically.

-   Students will have a full-lab time (75 minutes) to write one of their body
    paragraphs as M4 In-class writing.

-   They will use an M4 in-class writing template provided in Moodle.

-   They should be on time and bring their laptop and a laptop charger.

-   During the in-class writing, they are only allowed to check their worksheet
    and the two articles given by your professor.

-   They should turn off the wifi before the in-class writing starts.

-   They are NOT allowed to use any translators during the in-class writing.
    Using a dictionary is fine.

-   At the end of the lab, ALL the students turn on the wifi and then submit
    their file to M4 on-going dropbox.

**[NOTEs to the facilitator]**

-   Make the M4 in-class writing template visible when everyone is ready to
    write their body paragraph.

-   Doublecheck if all the students’ wifi is turned off.

-   Doublecheck if they are referring to their M4 Group Worksheet and M4
    individual thesis.

-   Doublecheck if they submitted a correct file to the M4 Ongoing Dropbox
    before they leave.

-   If many of the students need more time, give them 5-10 minutes more.

### M4 Final Essay: 10%

-   Doublecheck your essay follows the M4 Assignment (Instructions) clearly.

-   Revise your body paragraph based on your professor’s feedback on your M4
    in-class writing. Do not include the same mistakes in your final draft. Your
    professor will check if you have read the professor’s feedback or not.

-   Before you submit your M4 Final essay file, review your essay based on “M4
    Checklist”. That is the most important step to get a good grade.

-   Submit your M4 Final essay file to the M4 Final Essay Dropbox (Turnitin) on
    time.

-   **Deadline**: by 11:59 pm (PDT.) on the following Sunday of Week 10-2.
