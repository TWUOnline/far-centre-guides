# Module 1: Introduction to Academic Writing


## Activity Checklist




**The First Day of the class (Lab 1)**

  - Print out the Course Syllabus and the Student Survey form given on
    our course site. Give them to our students on the first day of the
    class.

  - Give students 15-20 minutes to read the course syllabus and help
    them understand it if necessary.

  - Then, give students about 30 minutes to complete the student survey
    form and submit it to you by the end of the class.

  - Scan the forms and save them in one file as PDF, and send it to the
    professor by email.

  - Introduce [how to get into
    Moodle](https://www.twu.ca/students/current-students) and show them
    how to navigate their dashboard in Moodle. Also, if you have
    remaining time, introduce [the Writing center support online (i.e.
    Writeaway)](https://www.twu.ca/student-life/student-success/writing-centre).
    If you don’t have enough time, please introduce it next class.

  - Attendance (and participation) can be recorded in this file. This
    file can be shared via Google.doc if preferred by both the
    instructor and facilitator. Please communicate with the professor.
    This attendance record should be reported to the professor by the
    last day of the semester.

    (About participation, check Class Activity 1.2 section. Its details
    are given there.)

  - **\[IMPORTANT Announcement to students\]**:

      - The facilitator will take attendance throughout this semester,
        so don’t miss the class. Your class attendance will be counted
        for the final grade of this course. Also, if you miss the class
        over 25%, you are NOT allowed to take a final exam (50%). Check
        the course syllabus for more details.

      - All individual activities which are formative learning
        activities will be graded. Whenever you finish one individual
        activity, you will receive “a full mark”, 5 points because your
        professor value the process of your spontaneous study. Please
        diligently work on these individual activities.




## Lesson 1: Academic Writing Basics

#### Class Activity 1.1 \[APA Template\]: (Individual work)

**Create an individual APA template (Microsoft document only)** based on
the instructions in Topic 2, and submit it to the designated Dropbox
given on our course site by the end of your class time. Submissions out
of the class time will not be accepted.

\[NOTE\]:

  - Be sure to bring your laptop to class and install Microsoft Word
    before class starts. Check with your facilitator for specific
    instructions on submitting this template to your instructor.

<!-- end list -->

  - Note that this activity is a part of your participation mark for
    this course.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

1.  Students should bring their own laptop to create their APA template.
    The reason is that their professor will check the authorship of the
    APA template to identify their plagiarism issue(s) possible during
    this semester.

2.  Students should install the official Microsoft Word. Please check if
    they have it or not in on the first day of the semester and inform
    that they should be ready to use it for creating APA template in the
    class under your administration.

3.  Students can freely check course materials and watch videos while
    creating their template.

4.  The file title of their APA template should be “APA template
    (Student’s official name)”.

5.  Please check if students’ submissions are appropriately completed
    before they leave the class.

6.  Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

## Lesson 3: APA Documentation

**Class Activity 1.2 \[Paraphrasing & APA documentation\]:** (Group
work: 3\~4 students per group) *– Forum page hidden view for students*

**There are 4 paragraphs about Terry Fox as a Canadian symbol on the
Canada’s History web page.** With your group partners, you will
paraphrase the first 3 paragraphs fully in your own words and indicate
proper citations. Then you will post your group work to the Forum page
given on our course site by the end of the class. Your professor will
give you brief written feedback online with a participation mark.

  - Reading: [History Idol: Terry
    Fox](https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/arts,-culture-society/history-idol-terry-fox)

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

This activity forum page has been hidden, so please activate the forum
page link for students when they need to do this activity in the class.
Ask students to read the 4 paragraphs about Terry Fox as a Canadian
symbol on the Canada’s History web page. They will paraphrase the first
3 paragraphs and submit their work as a group to the Moodle Dropbox
during class time.

1.  Grouping 3 students per group is ideal, but a group of 4 is
    possible.

2.  DO NOT let them work individually. Encourage students to paraphrase
    each paragraph TOGETHER step by step.

3.  Students can freely check course materials while paraphrasing.

4.  They can either submit a Word file or directly post their written
    work to the Forum page.

> *<span class="underline">How to post their work to the Forum
> page?</span>*

1.  Click “Add a new discussion topic”.

2.  Write down each group members’ name in the “Subject” section.

3.  Post their work to the “Message” section or upload their file to the
    “Attachment” section.

4.  Click “Post to forum”.

<!-- end list -->

5.  Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

6.  Please use the excel file provided below in order to record each
    student’s contribution to the group work ranged from 5 to 0. You
    will need to send the file to the professor by the end of the
    semester. The example excel file is attached here. (This file can
    also be shared via Google.doc if both the instructor and facilitator
    prefer.)

7.  (If the internet is out of service accidentally, you can print out
    the article and give it to them. They can submit their hand-written
    work to you, but you need to scan their work and send it to the
    professor.)

**Class Activity 1.3 \[References\]:** (Group work: 5 students per
group)

*– Forum page Hidden view for students*

**FIVE different sources are given on this forum page.** With your group
partners, make a references list in alphabetical order on a Microsoft
Word document. Post your group work to the Forum page by the end of the
class. Your professor will give you brief written feedback online with a
participation mark.

  - Source 1 (Website): [History Idol: Terry
    Fox](https://www.canadashistory.ca/explore/arts,-culture-society/history-idol-terry-fox)

  - Source 2 (Encyclopedia): [Terry
    Fox](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/terry-fox)

  - Source 5 (E-book): [Terry Fox: His
    Story](https://books.google.ca/books?id=rdel1p9KahQC&source=gbs_book_other_versions)

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

This activity forum page has been hidden, so please activate the forum
page link for students when they need to do this activity in the class.

1.  Grouping 5 students per group is ideal, but if some groups have less
    than 5 students, one or two students may need to complete more than
    one source.

2.  Each group member is assigned to finish one source out of 5. After
    all group members finish organizing their source, combine them in
    one file and organize them in alphabetical order. Then, give them
    time to give each other feedback and revise their work.

3.  Students can freely check course materials while making the
    references list.

4.  They should directly upload their Word file as a group to the Forum
    page by the end of the class.

*How to post their work to the Forum page?

1.  Click “Add a new discussion topic”.

2.  Write down each group members’ name in the “Subject” section.

3.  Upload their file to the “Attachment” section.

4.  Click “Post to forum”.

5.  Please take attendance. This will be counted for a participation
    mark.

6.  Please make a note on who participated the most and let the
    professor know by email.

7.  In case of Internet or power outage, please print out the articles
    in advance.

    Then, you can give the hand-outs to them. They can submit their
    hand-written work to you “as a group”, but you need to scan their
    work and send it to the professor by email.)

**\[Note to the Facilitator for APA Quiz Prep.\]**

![](media/image2.png)This dropbox is Turnitin dropbox which is different
from regular dropbox. You will need to help students to activate their
Turnitin dropbox one week earlier for the APA quiz. Please find time for
this in advance. The detailed instructions are given

  - How to activate the Turnitin dropbox?

      - Click the APA quiz dropbox link.

      - There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of the
        dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the “I
        agree” box and click “OK”.

      - Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that they
        can submit their file to the dropbox.

  - If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate it,
    direct them to submit their file to the previous APA template
    dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then, please inform the
    issue to the professor by email immediately.

## Lesson 4: Academic Tone

## Assessment

In Module 1, you participated in a number of in-class activities,
including creating an individual APA template, paraphrasing paragraphs
from a website, and making a references list. These three assignments
are to be completed in class and submitted to the professor via Moodle
Dropbox or Forum pages. Check with your Facilitator for exact dates and
submission instructions.

In addition to the in-class assignments, there are seven individual
activities, but the Individual Activities 1.1\~1.3 are only graded. You
will receive 5 points for the “completion” of each activity. Please

### APA Quiz: 3%

After you have completed Module 1, you will take an in-class quiz.
Please read the details below and study the Module 1 materials and
practice activities. Check with your Facilitator for the exact date of
the exam.

  - **Duration of the exam: Total- 1 hour and 30 minutes.**

      - Part 1 & 2: 40 minutes.

      - Part 3: 50 minutes

  - **The Quiz consists of:**

      - Part 1: True/False (20 marks)

      - Part 2: Multiple choices- A, B, C, D style (20 marks)

      - Part 3: APA writing task (60 marks)- One short article about a
        Canadian icon will be given.

        1.  **Write ONE paragraph- 150-200 words**

        2.  **Use YOUR APA template** (The failure of using your APA
            template automatically results in "0" mark on the writing
            task. That is, don't borrow your friend's APA template.)

        3.  **Decide your own title based on the given reading
            article.**

        4.  **Essay Type that you need to indicate on your title page is
            APA Essay**

        5.  **Include 2 pieces of evidence** from the given article.

              - *One direct quotation and the other paraphrased*

              - *OR two pieces of evidence can be all paraphrased in
                your own words.*

Before this quiz, please be sure that you have revised your APA template
based on my APA tutorial videos and APA Template Setup Checklist \[NOTE:
if you have technical difficulties, please talk to your facilitator.\].
You must use your APA template to complete a writing task for the quiz.
If not, the mark of your part 3 will be “0”.

**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

  - The quiz materials will be open to the facilitator 1\~2 days earlier
    (This can be negotiated by communications based on the facilitator’s
    situation. This is because school administrators who want their
    students to get a good mark and pass the course might give pressure
    to the facilitator to show the exam materials to them in advance.)

      - As soon as the quiz materials are up, the facilitator can print
        out Part 1 and 2 and prepare Scantron.

      - For Part 3, as soon as students are done with Part 1 and 2,
        collect their exam materials and scantrons. After that, ask them
        to open their laptop and their APA template. Then, you activate
        the Part 3 reading PDF link hidden on the Module 1 page when the
        students are ready to start Part 3. Be sure that they need to
        refresh their Module 1 page so that they can see the Part 3
        reading file that you just activated.

  - Inform this information to students 1 week earlier.

      - Students should bring their laptop for the test. IF not, their
        mark on part 3 will be “0”.

      - Part 1 and 2 will be done in Scantron. Thus, students also need
        to bring a pencil and eraser.

      - Students should use their OWN APA template for part 3. IF not,
        their mark on part 3 will be “0”.

  - By the END of the exam, students must upload their APA template
    (i.e. the completion of part 3) to the dropbox given on the Module 1
    course site. **\[IMPORTANT\]:** Please check if they successfully
    upload their file to the given Dropbox or not before they leave the
    classroom.

      - ![](media/image2.png)This dropbox is Turnitin dropbox which is
        different from regular dropbox. You will need to help students
        to activate their Turnitin dropbox one week earlier for the APA
        quiz. Please find time for this in advance.

      - How to activate the Turnitin dropbox?

        6.  Click the APA quiz dropbox link.

        7.  There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of
            the dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the
            “I agree” box and click “OK”.

        8.  Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that
            they can submit their file to the dropbox.

      - If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate
        it, direct them to submit their file to the previous APA
        template dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then,
        please inform the issue to the professor by email immediately.

  - The facilitator will receive the answer keys within 24 hours, so
    evaluate all the students’ part 1 and 2, and then send the results
    to the professor by email immediately in 24 hours after the quiz.
