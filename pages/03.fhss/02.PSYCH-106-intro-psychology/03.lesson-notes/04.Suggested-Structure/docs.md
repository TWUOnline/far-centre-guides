## Unit 2: Intelligence Testing

***Topic 1***

In this topic, student's will learn about Intelligence Tests. In addition, they will also have the opportunity to take some intelligence tests. In that context, student's are asked to respond to the following:

 - How do you feel about the EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TESTS? Did you learn anything? If so, what were the important areas that were illumined by the test?
 - Is ‘emotional intelligence’ a valid concept worth measuring?
 - Do you believe E-IQ is more important than "intelligence" as measured by IQ scores for success and happiness in your life?”

***Topic 2***

Although this Topic continues to build upon Topic 1, the guiding question focuses on intelligence from a Christian perspective:

*The Bible says, in James; Chapter 2:*

*My brothers, as believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ, don't show favoritism. Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes, and a poor man in shabby clothes also comes in. If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there" or "Sit on the floor by my feet," have you not discriminated among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?*

 - Could we be guilty of favoritism in esteeming more intelligent people above less intelligent people? In society? In Church?

***Topic 3***

Finally, this Topic looks at Nature and IQ. Students are asked to consider the following:

*If you suggest that Asians have darker skin than Caucasians, you are not considered racist; this is an obvious fact with a genetic basis. However, if you suggest that Asians are more intelligent than Caucasians (as IQ tests show), or that African Americans are less intelligent, watch out!*

 - What is different about these two claims that makes us accept one and not the other? Is it the role of nature versus nurture? Or is it more closely tied to the high value our culture places on intelligence, and especially IQ scores?

 - If IQ were unimportant would it matter if one racial or gender group tended to score higher than another group? Would you be considered racist or sexist for suggesting this?
