## Unit 8: The Seven Quality Tools

This unit focuses on data collection and reporting (part of “Monitoring and Controlling”, discussed in several other courses), and is therefore part of the prior unit because the SPC can now be charted. This unit focuses on the ‘monitoring’ part of “Monitoring and Controlling.”

Your actions are:

- You need to be comfortable running this exercise. This activity can only be successful when all can understand how to build charts using Excel.
 - It may prove to help by watching additional web videos on just doing that
- This unit requires the downloading of free software. This software is very similar to the powerful Microsoft Visio program, but has no fees.
 - Do not hesitate to play the tutorial(s) as needed
- This unit also requires the students to ‘create data’ by throwing dice. A pair of dice will need to be obtained for each group of 3 to 5 students.
