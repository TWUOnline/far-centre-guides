In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

## Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the Facilitated Learning Lab.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments.  In their Facilitated Learning Lab, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.  

## Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the unit content provided by the instructor and engage in several learning activities.  As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class.

## Lab Assignments & Learning Activities
Note that many Labs will be devoted to certain assignments and activities.  On the next pages are details for the lessons and assignments. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.
