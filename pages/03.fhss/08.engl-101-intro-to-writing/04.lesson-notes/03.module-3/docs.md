# Module 3 – Research Writing
## Theme: Social and Environmental Justice


## Activity Checklist

!! See the schedule for Module 3 [here](Schedule-for-Module-3.pdf)
!! Also refer to this [checklist](Module3-checklist.pdf) of learning activities and assessments

<span style="color:red">**[NOTEs to the facilitator]: The First Day of the lab (Lab 1)**</span>
- Explain the Module 3 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of M3 research outline, M3 in-class writing, and M3 research paper. 
- Help students to find THREE important files given on Module 3 page in Moodle:
     1)	[M3 Research Paper (Assignment Instructions)](M3-Research-Paper-Assignment-Instructions.pdf)
 
     2)	[M3 Research Outline (Template)](M3-Research-Outline-Template.docx)
 
     3)	[M3 In-Class Writing template](M3-In-Class-Writing-template.docx): (Make this hidden file visible to students at the beginning of the LAST lab (Lab 6) before they turn off the wifi.) 
        

- Introduce the instructions of Module 3 Assignment. Make sure that students read the instructions. 
- Doublecheck if students have read Lesson 1 and watched the lesson video(s). 
- There is also an M3- Ongoing Dropbox where they can save their paper drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their research outline and essay drafts, they need to save their files such as “M3 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M3 draft 2 (Your name)”. The purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox is to:
     1)	encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that can show a professor the process of their writing work.  
     2)	avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then continue their writing. 
     3)	be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox, there will be a consequence based on the weight of their plagiarism issue. 
- The final essay dropbox (Turnitin) will be automatically closed at the due time, so encourage students to submit their final essay file on time. When they mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted their essay to the professor by email. 
     1)	There might be one or two students whose final essay dropbox doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error). In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M3 ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file, too. 
- If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official medical report.  
- Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, there will be a panalty on their “final” grade of this course at the end of the semester. 

### Lab Activity 3.1 [Lesson 1- Revising Research Question]
- Use the Topic Development template that you have already completed in the Lab Activity 2.2 of Module 2 and revise it if necessary. 
- Find/Read 2 more articles and revise your research question based on Lesson 1. 
   - TWU library homepage
     - Google Advanced Search
     - Google Scholar Search
     - TWU Library OneSearch
- Write one short paragraph (approx. 100 words) to explain why you had to revise your research question and why your new research question is not too broader or narrower.   
- Post your paragraph and the Topic Development template revised to this forum page.

### Lesson 4
<span style="color:red">**[NOTEs to the facilitator]:**</span>

6. <span style="color:red">*Before you dismiss the lab, make an announcement on Individual Activity 3.3 which is the first step of students’ research outline. They must finish the Individual Activity 3.3 before the next lab. Introduce the research outline template and ask them to start writing an introduction paragraph with a thesis.  In Individual Activity 3.4, they will work on the research outline for the background paragraph. They will work on their research outline step by step like this, so you need to make sure that they follow this process diligently.*</span> 

### Individual Activity 3.3 [Lesson 4: Introduction & Thesis]

Based on your research question and your research, write an introduction paragraph with a clear thesis statement. This is the first draft of your research paper. Use the given outline template. Submit the first part of your outline as your first draft to M3 Ongoing Dropbox. 
 
[NOTE]: Ask your facilitator for the deadline of this individual activity. This submission is MANDATORY. You don’t have to finish the entire outline this time. You will complete this research outline in further individual activities of Module 3 step by step.

On the day of Lab 6, students MUST bring their laptop to write one body paragraph for M3 in-class writing. They only have 75 minutes. They can use course materials while writing, but they are NOT allowed to use a translator online. Also, they should not copy and paste the body paragraphs that they prepared out of the lab. They must write one new paragraph in the lab under your administration. They should submit it to M3 Ongoing Dropbox by the end of the lab. 

Remind students that they need to meet with their writing coach to revise their essay diligently.

### Assessment 

<span style="color:red">**[NOTEs to the facilitator]:**</span>
- Make the M3 in-class writing template visible when everyone is ready to write their body paragraph. 
- Doublecheck if all the students have their own laptop.
- Doublecheck if they are referring to their M3 research outline and course-related materials ONLY.
- Doublecheck if they submitted a correct file before they leave. 
- If many of the students need more time, give them 5 minutes more.
