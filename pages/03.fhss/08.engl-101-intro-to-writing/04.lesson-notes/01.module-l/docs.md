  - Attendance (and participation) can be recorded in this [file](Worksheet-in-ENGL-101 _M1.xlsx). This file can be shared via Google.doc, if preferred by both the instructor and facilitator. Please communicate with the professor. This attendance record should be reported to the professor by the last day of the semester. 

* **[IMPORTANT Announcement to students]**: 
    * The facilitator will take attendance throughout this semester, so don’t miss the lab. Your lab attendance will be counted for the final grade of this course.  Also, if you miss the lab over 25%, you are NOT allowed to take a final exam (30%). Check the course syllabus for more details. 
    * All lab activities which are the part of formative learning activities will be graded. Whenever you finish one lab activity, your facilitator will record your participation (0~5 points/activity). Do not worry about the final product of your activities because your professor values the process of your spontaneous study. Please diligently work on these lab activities.  

## Lesson 1: Expectations of Academic Writing

#### Class Activity 1.1 [Lesson 1- Reading Check] – True/False (H5P)

**Check your understanding of expectations of academic writing**. This individual activity consists of 10 TRUE or FALSE questions. Read each statement and decide if your answer is true or false. You can review this activity as many as you like. (H5P activity)

## Lesson 2: Overview of APA Format

#### Lab Activity 1.1 [APA Template]: (Individual work)

**Create an individual APA template (Microsoft document only)** based on the tutorial video on how to create an APA template. Submit your APA template to the designated Dropbox (i.e. M1 Ongoing Dropbox) given on our course site by the end of your lab time. Submissions out of the lab time will not be accepted. 
[NOTE]: 
  - Be sure to bring your laptop to the lab and install Microsoft Word before the lab starts.  Check with your facilitator for specific instructions on submitting this template to your instructor. 
  - Note that this activity is a part of your participation mark for this course.
  
**\[NOTEs to the facilitator\]**

1. Please take attendance.
2. Students should bring their own laptop to create their APA template. The reason is that their professor will check the authorship of the APA template to identify their plagiarism issue(s) possible during this semester. 
3. Students should install the official Microsoft Word in advance. Please check if they have it or not in on the first day of the semester and inform that they should be ready to use it for creating APA template in the lab under your administration. 
4. Students can freely check course materials and watch videos while creating their template. 
5. The file title of their APA template should be “APA template (Student’s official name)”. 
6. Please check if students’ submissions are appropriately completed before they leave the lab.
7. Record students’ particitation ranging from 5 to 0 in the [excel file](Worksheet-in-ENGL-101 _M1.xlsx) provided. You will need to send the file to the professor by the end of the semester. The example excel file is attached here. (This file can also be shared via Google.doc if both the instructor and facilitator prefer.)

## Lesson 3: APA Documentation

[NOTE]: *This individual activity is to help you to check your understanding of expectations of academic writing. This is not graded, but at the end of the semester, your professor will give you a bonus mark on your participation if you complete all the individual activities in each module diligently*.

**Lab Activity 1.2 [APA Documentation] –Practice (Group work)**

**Check Your Understanding of In-text Citation**. The citation of each evidence is incorrect. With your partner(s), identify the incorrect part of each citation and explain reasons. There might be more than one answer possible. Post your group work to the Forum page given on our course site by the end of the lab. Your professor will post possible answers to the same forum page, so please compare your answers with your professor’s after the lab. 

1. Research states, “in 2008 The Royal College of psychiatrist in the UK published a report warning that having an abortion might damage a woman’s mental health” (BBC).
2. As Jack Donnelly, author of the book universal human rights in theory and practice, writes: “human rights – droits de l’homme, derechos humanos, menschenrechte, “the rights of man” – are, literally, the rights that one has because one is human” (Donnelly p.11).
3. The ICTR is created by United Nation to prosecute persons who are, “responsible for genocide or other serious violations of international humanitarian law” (International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, 1994).
4. Furthermore, the government in Texas found that, “sending people to prison was costing 10 times as much as putting them on probation, on parole, or in treatment” (2011).
5. The victim’s family said only “the death penalty could deter serious crimes” (Adams, 2011).
6. According to the article by Jonathan Adams (2011), it states that, “Everybody speaks for people who are still alive” but “what about the rights of the dead and [his] brother and [his brother’s] wife cannot return from the dead; the law should give them justice” (2011).

**[NOTEs to the facilitator]**

This activity forum page has been hidden, so please activate the forum page link for students when they need to do this activity in the lab.
1. Grouping 5 students per group is ideal, but if some groups have less than 5 students, one or two students may need to complete more than one source.  
2. Each group member is assigned to finish one source out of 5. After all group members finish organizing their source, combine them in one file and organize them in alphabetical order. Then, give them time to give each other feedback and revise their work.  
3. Students can freely check course materials while making the references list.  
4. They should directly upload their Word file as a group to the Forum page by the end of the lab. 
5. After you make sure of their group submission, post my reference list  [(i.e example file)](References-practice.pdf) for students.
 
6. Please keep recording students’ participation on the excel file provided.
7. In case of Internet or power outage, please let students do this individually at home. Then, give them 1 day to finish the task and submit their file to the forum page. In this case, post my example file after you make sure of their submission.)


**[Note to the Facilitator for APA Quiz Prep.]**

![alt-text](APA-Quiz.jpg)

This dropbox is Turnitin dropbox which is different from regular dropbox. You will need to help students to activate their Turnitin dropbox one week earlier for the APA quiz. Please find time for this in advance. The detailed instructions are given 
* How to activate the Turnitin dropbox? 
  * Click the APA quiz dropbox link.
  * There will be a message as a blue-link form on the middle of the dropbox page. They need to click the link and check the “I agree” box and click “OK”. 
  * Then, they will receive a receipt that can indicate that they can submit their file to the dropbox. 
- If students keep getting an error message and cannot activate it, direct them to submit their file to the previous APA template dropbox where they can save up to 20 files. Then, please inform the issue to the professor by email immediately.
