# Module 2: Writing the Annotated Bibliography

## Theme: Social and Environmental Justice

## Week 3-2
**The First Day of the class (Week 3-2)**

  - Explain the Module 2 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of M2 worksheet, M2 in-class writing, and M2 final essay.
  - Help students to find THREE important files given on Module 2 page in Moodle:
     1. [M2 The Annotated Bibliography (Assignment Instructions)]()
 
     2) [M2 Worksheet (Template)]()
 
     3) [M2 Worksheet (Example)]()
 
     4) [M2 In-Class Writing template](): (Make this hidden file visible to students at the beginning of the LAST lab (Lab 5) before they turn off the wifi.)
        

- Introduce the instructions of Module 2 Assignment. Make sure that students read the instructions. 
- Doublecheck if students have read Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 and watched lesson videos. 
- Doublecheck if they did Pre-lab activity 1.1 as homework. This homework must be done before Lab 1.
- There is also an M2- Ongoing Dropbox where they can save their paper drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their annotated bibliographies, they need to save their files such as “M2 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M2 draft 2 (Your name)”. The purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox is to:
   1) encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that can show a professor the process of their writing work.  
   2) avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then continue their writing. 
   3) be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox, there will be a consequence based on the weight of their plagiarism issue. 
- The final essay dropbox (Turnitin) will be automatically closed at the due time, so encourage students to submit their final essay file on time. When they mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted their essay to the professor by email. 
   1) There might be one or two students whose final essay dropbox doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error). In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M2 ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file, too. 
- If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official medical report.  
- Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at the end of the semester. 
- When they email the professor, they should indicate their official (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to indicate their identification clearly.
