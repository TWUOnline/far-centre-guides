# Module 2: Writing the Annotated Bibliography

## Theme: Social and Environmental Justice

## Week 3-2
**The First Day of the class (Week 3-2)**

  - Explain the Module 2 schedule above and highlight the deadlines of M2 worksheet, M2 in-class writing, and M2 final essay.
  - Help students to find THREE important files given on Module 2 page in Moodle:
     1. [M2 The Annotated Bibliography (Assignment Instructions)](M2-Annotated-Bibliography-(Assignment-Instructions).pdf)
 
     2) [M2 Worksheet (Template)](M2-Worksheet.docx)
 
     3) [M2 Worksheet (Example)](M2-Worksheet-Template.pdf)
 
     4) [M2 In-Class Writing template](M2-Annotated-Bibliography-In-Class-Writing.docx): (Make this hidden file visible to students at the beginning of the LAST lab (Lab 5) before they turn off the wifi.)
        

- Introduce the instructions of Module 2 Assignment. Make sure that students read the instructions. 
- Doublecheck if students have read Lesson 1 and Lesson 2 and watched lesson videos. 
- Doublecheck if they did Pre-lab activity 1.1 as homework. This homework must be done before Lab 1.
- There is also an M2- Ongoing Dropbox where they can save their paper drafts up to 20. Whenever they update/revise their annotated bibliographies, they need to save their files such as “M2 draft 1 (Your name)”, and “M2 draft 2 (Your name)”. The purpose of this “ongoing” Dropbox is to:
   1) encourage students to work on their essay ‘step by step’ that can show a professor the process of their writing work.  
   2) avoid losing their writing work accidentally. That is, they can check this Dropbox to check their previous work, and then continue their writing. 
   3) be evidence to prove the originality of their writing work when they face an academic dishonesty issue. When those who face the plagiarism issue don’t have any files in this ongoing dropbox, there will be a consequence based on the weight of their plagiarism issue. 
- The final essay dropbox (Turnitin) will be automatically closed at the due time, so encourage students to submit their final essay file on time. When they mistakenly submitted a wrong file, the facilitator (or the professor) can delete the wrong file for them and give them a second chance to resubmit it “immediately”. When the facilitator deletes their wrong file, please send the list of students who resubmitted their essay to the professor by email. 
   1) There might be one or two students whose final essay dropbox doesn’t allow them to submit their essay (i.e. technical error). In this case, ask them to submit their final essay to their M2 ongoing dropbox and email the professor with the essay file, too. 
- If students had to miss the deadline of the essay due to an urgent issue related to “family or severe sickness”, they should communicate with the professor promptly by email. In terms of sickness, they will need to provide the professor with an official medical report.  
- Inform that if their late submission becomes a pattern, it will result in the 3% deduction of their “final” grade of this course at the end of the semester. 
- When they email the professor, they should indicate their official (and English) name, student ID, and class name. Their professor will probably have over 100 students this semester, so it is important to indicate their identification clearly. 

### Pre-lab Activity 1.1 [Choice of Your Research Topic]: (Individual work) –Forum

**[NOTEs to the facilitator]**
- This pre-lab activity should be done before the lab, so please make an announcement on this assignment in advance. 
- The list of research topics will change every semester, so please communicate with the professor to receive a new topic list in advance by email if you had already used this topic list last semester. 

### Lab Activity 1.2 [Topic Development]: (Individual work) –Forum
Task 1: 
- Use a Topic Development template provided to narrow down your research topic. For your understanding, one example template is provided, so check the example and complete your template in the same way. 
- After you complete your template, write one short paragraph (approx. 100 words) to summarize how you have narrowed down your topic. 
- Post your paragraph and Topic Development template to this forum page.  

Task 2: After Task 1, check two postings done by your classmates and give them brief feedback. 

[NOTE]: 
- Check the deadline of each task with your facilitator. 



 [NOTEs to the facilitator]
1. Please take attendance.
2. Students should bring their own laptop to complete Lab activity 1.2. 
3. Make these pages on Moodle visible to students at the beginning of the lab. 
   - Forum page (Lab activity 1.2)
   - [Topic Development Template]()
 
   - [Topic Development Template (Example)]()
 
4. Students must check/read the example template first.
5. Students will probably need more time to complete Task 1, so give them 2~3 more hours to post their work to the forum page out of the lab.  In terms of Task 2, after you make sure of all the students’ submission, give them 1 day to do peer-review after Task 1. To set up the deadlines of these two tasks, please communicate with the professor in advance. 
6. After the Task 2 is done, the professor will post his/her brief feedback to each student.
7. This activity must be fully completed.
