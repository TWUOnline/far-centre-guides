## Unit 2: Heart of Servant Leadership

There are two activities in this unit that can be done in the lab. 

Additionally, teaching the students what a case study is all about, the roles of case studies in deepening learning and how to approach a case study would be beneficial.

**Activity 2.1: Southwest Airlines Case Study**

**Read the following**:
 	1. Review the PPT posted and follow the prompts within. 
    2. This activity could be done in groups of 2 or 3.
    3. Allow 30-60 minutes for this activity.
    
**Activity 2.2: Read, Reflect, and Create**

**Read the following**:
 	1. Read *Lead Like Jesus*, by Blanchard, Hodges & Hendry: Chapters 8-11
 	2. Create a word cloud with [these ideas](https://worditout.com). Play around until one or two visuals seem to capture the ideas important to you about EGO and leadership. Here is a simple example I just created:

   3. Review this activity with students in the lab (either how to create a word cloud and/or share their word clouds with the rest of the class). 
   4. Allow 30-45 minutes for this activity.
