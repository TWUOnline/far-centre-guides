## Unit 2: Heart of Servant Leadership

###**Lab Activity: Case Study & Word Clouds**

The following two unit activities can be done in the learning lab. Additionally, teaching the students what a case study is all about, the roles of case studies in deepening learning and how to approach a case study would be beneficial.

**Activity 2.1: Southwest Airlines Case Study**

This case study examines Southwest Airlines as an organziation that beautifully exemplifies servant leadership in action. This case study provides the learners with video clips and articles to read, watch and then evaluate the characteristics of servant leadership as they observe from media provided. Simply follow the prompts and directions in the PPT to carry out this activity.

**Read and Respond to the following**:
 	1. Review the PPT posted in the moodle and follow the prompts within. 
    2. This activity could be done in groups of 2 or 3.
    3. Allow 30-60 minutes for this activity.
    4. Have students share their ideas and answers in the lab.
    
**Activity 2.2: Read, Reflect, and Create**

This activity ignites some creativity with key word identification from assigned readings from this unit.

**Read the following**:
 	1. Read *Lead Like Jesus*, by Blanchard, Hodges & Hendry: Chapters 8-11
 	2. Create a word cloud with [these ideas](https://worditout.com). Play around until one or two visuals seem to capture the ideas important to you about EGO and leadership. Here is a simple example I just created:

   3. Review this activity with students in the lab (either how to create a word cloud and/or share their word clouds with the rest of the class). 
   4. Allow 30-45 minutes for this activity.
