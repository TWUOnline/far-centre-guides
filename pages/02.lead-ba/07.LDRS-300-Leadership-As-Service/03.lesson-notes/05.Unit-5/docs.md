## Unit 5: The Leader’s Behaviours: The Hands of a Great Leader

###Lab Activity: Artifact Object Lesson
**Purpose**:
- Generate some creative discussion about the details and work that goes into something handmade and connecting those ideas to the what a leader puts their hand to/ servant leadership.

**Details**:
-	Use as an ice-breaker activity.
-	Can be individuals, pairs or groups of 3
-	Either ask students to bring to the lab an item from home that is handmade. Conversely bring in a few handmade items to pass around the lab. If they can bring something culturally significant or unique that would deepen the connection we are making with the work of our hands and the work of a servant leaders hands.
-   If bringing physical items into the lab is a challenge, either you, as facilitator, find some images on the computer for the students to interact with. Conversely, have them find their own images on the internet.
-	Time: 5-10 minutes prep. 1-3 minutes per person to present to class.

**Say**:
-	Each group/ student has been given an item that is handmade. Think about what we just learned about the similarities between carpentry/ tradesperson and a leader.
-	Using the item given to you, how could you explain to someone the similarities between a carpenter and a leader.  Get creative. Get thinking. This is called an object lesson!
-	Be prepared to share your 1-3 minute object lesson with the rest of the class.

###Lab Activity: Coaching Skills 101

-	*Practice*: Practice a coaching session in the lab (20-30 minutes)

**Details**:

-	*Evaluate*: Watch & Evaluate: Coaching demo by Essential Impact [click here](https://essentialimpact.com/blog/excelerate-leadership-dave-marj-coaching-demo/)
  - Evaluate as a group the demonstration they watched. Discuss observations, reflections and key takeaways they can use in their own leadership coaching.

-	*Practice*: Find a partner and do a mini-coaching session in the lab. Have 1 person be the coach and the other the coachee. Ideally if you have three people, the third person is the observer and takes notes and then provides helpful feedback about the session to the other two students. You can set a limit of 10 minutes, then debrief. Then switch the partners and do a second coaching session. If there are just groups of two, the facilitator can observe and provide some helpful feedback to the students.
