#### Lab Activity: Culture Mapping 1,2,4, All

Review this unit in the moodle. This unit examines the role of culture, servant leadership cultures 
and orgnaizational cultures in assessing and analysizng customer-focused cultures. This activity
asks students to create their own culture maps based on one of the two models
presented in this unit's PPT. Once completed, let the sharing (and collective learning) begin!

Step 1: Individually: At your tables choose **one of the two culture models**
and map out your unique culture. (10 minutes)

Step 2: Grab a partner: Together with your partner, compare your culture maps.
What things are similar? What are different? Explain your maps to each other,
highlighting the things most important to you. Explain why they are important to
you. (10 minutes)

Step 3: Form a group of 4 people and compare your culture maps. Let each person
have 1 minute to explain their map. Go around until everyone has had a chance to
share their map. Then together create a new map, generating discussion amongst
each person in the group, share your differences and similarities. Consider
including on your new group map things like regional differences, personal
experiences, family traditions, etc. Note places of disagreement or unanimity
when it comes to what you record on your culture map. Once complete, have groups
share their maps with the other groups.

#### Lab Activity: The Power of Hostmanship – Tedx Talk by Jan Gunnarsson.
Jan Gunnarsson is a hospitality industry veteran from Sweden who exhibits a
refreshing take upon customer service and leadership. Jan believes customer
experience is not in the first place about strategies and tactics but about the
attitude we bring. Jan talks about how the heart of a business is an attitude of
yourself. Hostmanship is the book he wrote with Olle Blohm. Hostmanship really
is about giving. It's about sharing a part of yourself and your knowledge. It’s
about treating others as you yourself would want to be treated and remembering
that no one can make that decision for you – how you show up each day is your
choice.

Watch this Ted Talk in the lab and then debrief his ideas. Use some of the 
following prompts to get you started:

1. Have you ever heard of this idea of "hostmanship' before?
2. What is the connection between leading and hosting? 
3. What idea of his impacted you and why?
4. Jan talks about how we welcome ourselves in the morning, saying,
*"It starts with welcoming yourself when you get up each morning. Be kind to yourself. Treat yourself like you would want others to treat you – respect, honor, friendship, laughter, love".* Discuss.
