## Unit 3: The Head of a Servant Leader: Whatâ€™s your Vision, Mission and Values?

###**Learning Lab Activity:**  
  **What**: Paper Bag Creations: Lead or Follow?  
  **Why**: To see how a group of people make decisions when tasked with a project in a specific time frame. Observations about who leads, who follows, why those dynamics unfolded and self-learning/ group learning about how to accomplish something together and how we feel about it in the end.  
  **How many people**: Can be used if you have 4 or more people. Put students in groups of 2, 3 or 4.  

###Details:
**PREP**: Assemble a couple of paper bags (or any bag that you cannot see inside) with 15-20 random items (LEGO, pens, tooth picks, bottle caps, string, etc.). Inside each bag write out an idea that the group has to work together to accomplish using only the items in the bag.

*For example*:
  - Create something that represents servant leadership
  - Create your ideal restaurant
  - Create the home of the future
  - Create your neighbourhood

**EXECUTE**:
Set a time limit for the activity (10-20 minutes). Make your own observations about what you see taking place. When the time is finished, have each group explain to the other groups what their task was, what they produced and explain the various parts of their creation.

**DEBRIEF**:  
*Part 1*: After all the groups have finished, have a group discussion using the following prompts:
  1.	What was difficult about this activity? What was easy?
  2.	Did everyone participate in your group? Why or why not?
  3.	How did you decide on the design?
  4.	Any other observations?

*Part 2*: Hand out a debrief sheet for them to each fill out. This debrief sheet should be uploaded to the moodle for the professor's perusal.
Provide any of your own feedback to the professor about this activity.
