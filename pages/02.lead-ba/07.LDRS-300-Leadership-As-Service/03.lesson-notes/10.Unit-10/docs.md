## Unit 10: Cultivating a Service Culture: Implementing the How

This final unit takes the student through the very practical steps of how to create and evaluate an organization's service culture. After this unit, students should be prepared to fully prepared to present their group project research and presentations.

### Lab Activity: Activity 10.6 A Case Study of Two Exceptional Service-Oriented Business Leaders

This case study lends itself well to students working in pairs. It can also be a great small group collective activity (3-5 students working together). There are several articles to read and videos to watch as they build their case study of these two leaders. Together the students are to create a response to their research of each of these leaders using with the headline, *“What I learned about leadership from Kristen Hadeed and Anthony Caselana”.* They can be creative and use whatever form they choose to show their work (written, ppt, prezi, video, audio, etc...). They are to include 1-2 key ideas that impacted them individually and 1 take-away they could use in their own leadership right now. This would be a great artefact for their E-portfolios as well.

### Lab Activity: Final Research Project Presentations (Group or Individual Projects)

Depending upon the size and make up the enrolled students in the FAR Centre, final presentations are to take place the last day of this course. Students are to present their work to the class, either as an indivual or as groups. Please film the presentations and have the students upload their video or link to their video along with their presentation PPT or Prezi. As a facilitator, pre-presentation coaching on practicing their presentation, graphic design, clarity of ideas, flow of presentators, pitch, presence in the room would be helpful to ease their anxiety and give them feedback before their final submission.
