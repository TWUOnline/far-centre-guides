## Unit 8: Case Study in Leadership: Saving Mr. Banks (2013)


This unit focuses on the film Saving Mr. Banks (2013). 

The students are to watch the film then complete a case study on leadership analysis as per the
details outlined in the Case Study Guidelines posted in the moodle. This case study gives the students the
opportunity to integrate the formal learning to date with their own lived
experiences and with what they observe and analyze from the film. The film
is accessible in terms of the universal values of empathy, forgiveness,
humility and creating connection. It is interesting the see some of the
changes undergone by the characters as they get to know one another and
their unique and sometimes painful pasts.

It would be helpful for you as a facilitator to also be familiar with the
movie. It could be shown in the lab as a lab activity with a debrief time
after. 

Review the case study guidelines prior to watching the film to help guide the debrief
conversations following the film. Student's should pay attention to the following themes: 
-   servant leadership charcteristics as demonstrated by the key characters;
-   where forgiveness shows up and the role of forgiveness in leading ourselves and others;
-   how to work with difficult people.

Conversely, you could do a character or characteristics profile in class.
Have students collectively create a poster or other creative artifact about
a character from the film or a servant leadership characteristic that was
demonstrated in the film.

E-Portfolio: Have students create a personal reflective artifact about the
film to include in their E-portfolio.

Prompts to consider:

-   Favorite scene from the film and why.

-   Would you recommend it as a case study in leadership? Why or why not?

-   Have students do some additional research about the story behind the story of this film â€“
there are some details left out. How is the reality v. the movie different?
