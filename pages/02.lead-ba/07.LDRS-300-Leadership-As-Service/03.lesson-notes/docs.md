# Lesson Notes for LDRS 300

The following pages provide key information for the LDRS 300 unit modules
(schedules, activity instructions, lab suggestions, key learnings, etc.). Please see the full course
notes on Moodle.

There are ungraded learning activities suggested in each unit to ignite the learners curiosity and deepen their understanding of course content. As a facilitator, please look at these activities as possible points of reflective disucssion in the learning lab. Several of them can also be extracted from the units and used in the labs as collective learning experiences. Just be prepared to let learners know ahead of time which activities you may facilitate in the lab. 

This facilitator's guide also provides unit specific activities suggested for lab interaction. Constraints such as time, context, resources and learner-specific needs will help guide your decsion-making as to which ones to engage in and others to pass on.
