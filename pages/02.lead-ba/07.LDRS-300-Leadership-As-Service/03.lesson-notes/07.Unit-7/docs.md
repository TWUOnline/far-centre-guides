## Unit 7: The  Leader’s Disciplines: The Doing Habits

###Lab Activity: Bring Activities 7.1 and/ or 7.2 Into the Lab

Review Lab Activities 7.1 (Dare to Lead Manifesto) & 7.2 (Love Languages) in Unit 7 in the course Moodle. Either one of these activities would work well in the lab as creative activities for students to spend time working on. These activities can be done physically, with pens, paper and creative elements (markers, magazine, glue sticks, stickers, etc...)to physically produce an artefact or virtually online using any variety of creative programs or apps (Canva, Prezi, Storybook, Sketchnote, etc...). These artefacts can be shared in the lab as an exercise for students to practice their presentation skills. Students can also get feedback from fellow learners as an exercise in peer review/ feedback. The artefacts can be sumbitted for grading by taking a photo and submitting it in the Moodle drop box. If students present their work in class, consider filming it and then having the student upload the video file to the Moodle for grading. If the SME is utilizing E-Portfolios in this course in the FAR Centre Lab, these would be excellent artefacts to include in a student's E-Portfolio.
