## Unit 7: The Behavioral Approach

This unit introduces students to the behavioral approach of leadership. This approach emphasizes the behavior of the leader. This distinguishes it from the trait approach, which emphasizes the personality characteristics of the leader, and the skills approach, which emphasizes the leader’s capabilities. The behavioral approach focuses exclusively on what leaders do and how they act.

These are the activities students are expected to complete before coming to the learning lab:

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Case Study Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the learning lab after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 7, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1. What is the central purpose of the behavioral approach?

  2. Explain the origin of the five major styles.

  3. In what types of situations might each of these styles be the best one to use?

  4. As a follower, how do you respond to each of these different leadership styles?

  5. Who is the best leader you know? The worst?

  6. To what extent does the style approach account for the differences between these leaders?

  7. Why does leadership style matter?

  8. Should leaders hire only those people who can work with the leader’s leadership style?

  9. What is your dominant grid style and when do you revert to your backup style?

### Part 2: Case Study Activity

Divide the class up into three different groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the case studies provided at the end of chapter 4. As a group, have the students read the case study together and answer the questions prepared at the end of the case study to guide discussion.

  -   Allow students to work on the case study and questions for 1 hour and then have students re-cap the key ideas discussed and present this information to the class in the last 30 minutes.

  -   The re-cap should highlight the key points from the discussion. Make sure to compare and contrast alternate viewpoints that came up during the discussion and emphasize the take-home messages that can be applied to future situations.

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each learning lab and then providing a score for each student at the end of the learning lab based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

***Note:*** An absence for **one** learning lab will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the learning lab is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response.

Next, they need to provide a case study response. They are asked to choose ONE of the case studies that interests them from Chapter 4 and answer the questions for it that are provided at the end of the case. This case study response is part 3 of 6.
