## Unit 1:  Leadership, Service and Jesus: An Introduction

Review the syllabus with students and strongly encourage them to follow the suggested due dates. You may want to say, "The due dates in this course are meant to "chunk" the course into manageable parts so that you are successful. Feel free to ‘go ahead’ but please don’t get behind. Sometimes life throws us challenges and set-backs and we might need to take a day away from the course, but please do your best to catch up the very next day. In an asynchronous environment it behooves us all to manage our time so that posts are up on time and ready to be responded to. This will avoid frustration for everyone!"

Take time to review the set-up of the moodle and familiarize yourself and the students with the course format, content and due dates.

**Course Cafe**
The course cafe is a forum for interaction between the facilitator, the learners and the course instructor. Use it for enouragement, to share resources, ask and answer questions pertinent to the entire course and post reminders for upcoming lab activities or assignment due dates. Consider planning an icebreaker activity based on Course Café introductions (e.g. peer interview, self-portraits, snowball, etc...). Here is a link to other ice breaker activities https://www.edgalaxy.com/journal/2012/8/27/10-great-activities-to-break-the-ice-with-your-students.html

*Activity 1.4: Comparing Models of Leadership*
<span style="color:red"> See Moodle for instructions. Let students know whether this will be a full lab activity, or whether they should start/complete their sketch note at home. </span>

*Activity 1.5: Ted Talk: Drew Dudley*
<span style="color:red"> See Moodle for instructions. This is a great, short and inspiring talk. This video could be shown in the lab with some meaningful discussion around the prompts listed after the video to spark discussion and connect to the readings in this unit. </span>
