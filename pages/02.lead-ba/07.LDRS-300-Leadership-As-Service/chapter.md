# LDRS 300: Leadership as Service

## Welcome to LDRS 300: Leadership as Service!

This course is organized into 10 units and is designed for an condensed 4 week course. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

- A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
- Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
- Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
- Learning activities that you will need to complete each week.
- Assessments pages will provide you with information about assignments that you will need to complete each week.

Over the next 4 weeks, you will have the opportunity to attend Facilitated Learning Labs. During lab times, a course facilitator will be guiding group discussions, answering any questions you may have, helping you understand your assignments, and evaluating your participation in class.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. We are here to help and be your guide on this journey.
