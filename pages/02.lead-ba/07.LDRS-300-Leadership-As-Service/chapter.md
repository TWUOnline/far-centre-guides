# LDRS 300: Leadership as Service

## Welcome to LDRS 300: Leadership as Service!

This course is organized into 10 units and is designed for an condensed 4-6 week course delivery. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

- A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.
- Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.
- Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.
- Learning activities that you will need to complete each week.
- Assessments pages will provide you with information about assignments that you will need to complete each week.

Over the next 4-6 weeks, you will be hosting Facilitated Learning Labs at a designated FAR Centre location. During lab times, as course facilitator, you will be guiding group discussions, answering any questions learners and faculty may have, helping learners understand the assignments, and evaluating their participation in labs as specified by the LDRS 300 Participation and Engagement Guidelines. 

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. We are here to bring clarity and supportive connection on this journey.
