## Unit 8: Situational Approach

This unit introduces you to one of the more widely recognized approaches to leadership--the situational approach. The situational approach has been refined and revised several times since its inception and it has been used extensively in organizational leadership training and development.

These are the activities students are expected to complete before coming to the learning lab:

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Case Study Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the learning lab after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 8, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1.  Provide examples of behaviors that correspond with four proposed styles.

  2.  Can you think of examples of followers who would fit each of the four proposed development levels?

  3.  Explain the two steps leaders must fulfill to be effective. Apply these steps to a current situation in which you are a follower. What style would be most appropriate for leading you, according to the theory, and why? Do you agree?

  4.  Does a leader’s motivation for adapting his or her leadership style have any effect on followers? In other words, would a leader with a high concern for task differ from a leader with a high concern for relationships?

  5.  Do you think the prescribed leadership behaviors in the SLII model apply to all cultures? Why or why not?

  6.  What would follower competence and commitment look like in your line of work (i.e., how are these qualities conceptualized)?

  7.  If a leader uses a different style of leadership with each of his followers, how might that lead to perceptions of favoritism? What could a leader do to avoid such impressions while still being adaptable to follower needs?

  8.  If a leader matches his or her style to the overall developmental level of the group he or she is leading, how might this affect the performance and motivation of the workers who are different?

  9.  How can a leader be sure his or her perceptions of followers’ competence and commitment are accurate?

  10. Why wouldn’t the coaching style be effective in every situation?

### Part 2: Case Study Activity

Divide the class up into three different groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the case studies provided at the end of chapter 5. As a group, have the students read the case study together and answer the questions prepared at the end of the case study to guide discussion.

  -   Allow students to work on the case study and questions for 1 hour and then have students re-cap the key ideas discussed and present this information to the class in the last 30 minutes.

  -   The re-cap should highlight the key points from the discussion. Make sure to compare and contrast alternate viewpoints that came up during the discussion and emphasize the take-home messages that can be applied to future situations.

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each learning lab and then providing a score for each student at the end of the learning lab based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

***Note:*** An absence for **one** learning lab will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the learning lab is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response.

Next, they need to provide a case study response. They are asked to choose ONE of the case studies that interests them from Chapter 5 and answer the questions for it that are provided at the end of the case. This case study response is part 4 of 6.
