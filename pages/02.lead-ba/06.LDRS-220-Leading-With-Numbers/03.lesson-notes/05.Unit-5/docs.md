## Unit 5: The Leader’s Behaviours: The Hands of a Great Leader

This unit now brings the knowledge from the first 4 units to a different perspective… on how mutual funds are a ‘collection of shares of varying companies’ “mutually funded” by the fund owners (that own shares in the fund, not the companies the fund possesses).

Your actions are:

- You should ask the students if there are any videos they would like to review.
- Again, there is a fair amount of web work to be included during this session. Each group will need access to the internet.
- Encourage discussion after videos and activities
 - If a student or team is ‘shy’, offer time for input before you move on
