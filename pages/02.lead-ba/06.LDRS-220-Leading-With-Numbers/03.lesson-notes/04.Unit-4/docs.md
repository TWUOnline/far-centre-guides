## Unit 4: Financial Statement Ratios

In this unit, we bring together the knowledge of the first three units and can now compare data (through the use of ratios):
- Within the organization
- From one company to another

Your actions are:

- Play the web-based videos (at the beginning of the Learning Lab) and solicit discussion
- Like last unit, there is a fair amount of web work to be included during this session. Each group will need access to the internet.
- This course requires the skill of copying of an Excel tab (the whole tab) to make more tabs. You may need to help with this.
- Each student/group may not have the correct answers, so reviewing results as a full group will permit students/groups to revise their work accordingly.
