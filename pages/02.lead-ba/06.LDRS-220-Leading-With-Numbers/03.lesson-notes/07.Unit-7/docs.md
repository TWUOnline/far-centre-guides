## Unit 7: Standard Deviation

This unit is a radical change from the prior 6 units. We now start our study into Statistical Process Control, or SPC, (using Standard Deviation as the primary tool).

Your actions are:

- Play the web-based videos (at the beginning of the Learning Lab) and solicit discussion
- Students will learn the manual calculation of standard deviation first… and this USUALLY proves to be overwhelming for some… but no worries… at the end we will reveal the AUTOMATIC way to do the calculation using Excel.
- One of the key concepts is to identify which formula to use (with the denominator as “N” or “N-1”)
 - “N” is used when the data is ALL of the data, from the entire ‘population’ of data
 - “N-1” is used when the data is a SAMPLE of all of the data available
 - There may be some occasions in real-world applications when this is hard to determine
  - “N-1” (SAMPLE) is best to default to, then, as it is more conservative
  - When the indecision is there, be sure to denote what formula was used, and why
- The answer key can be found on the Sheet 2 tab, beginning at column AA

**Facilitator’s Note:** ANY collection of similar data can work. Just denote so in the final work as to what data was collected.
