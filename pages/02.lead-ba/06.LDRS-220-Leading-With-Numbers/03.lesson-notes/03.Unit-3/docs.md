## Unit 3: Financial Statements - Part 2

This is the second of 2 units that discuss the 4 common organizational financial statements. Your actions are:

-	Play the web-based videos (at the beginning of the Learning Lab) and solicit discussion
- There is a fair amount of web work to be included during this session. Each group will need access to the internet.
- Finding financial statement information can be a challenge, as companies use different labels in their annual reports... and the reports are more of a ‘story’ than just financial presentations... if need be, have the entire class do the activities together
- Each student/group may not have the correct answers, so reviewing results as a full group will permit students/groups to revise their work accordingly.
