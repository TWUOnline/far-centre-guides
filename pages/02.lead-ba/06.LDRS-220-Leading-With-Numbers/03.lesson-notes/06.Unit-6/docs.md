## Unit 6: Budgets

Using concepts from the prior units, this unit gives an opportunity for students to learn about budgets and build their own.

Your actions are:

- Again, there is a fair amount of web work to be included during this session. Each group will need access to the internet.
- For the ‘Variance’ activity, students will need to have the skill to Sort in Excel
 - They will sort by the variance amount
 - The result should be the Variance column has the highest (positive) number in the top row, then getting smaller, to zero, somewhere in the middle; finally, getting to the largest negative number at the bottom.
 - Offer assistance as necessary
- Encourage discussion after videos and activities
 - If a student or team is ‘shy’, offer time for input before you move on
