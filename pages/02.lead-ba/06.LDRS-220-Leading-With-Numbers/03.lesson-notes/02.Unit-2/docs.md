## Unit 2: Financial Statements - Part 1

This week is the first of 2 units discussing the 4 common organizational financial statements. Your primary actions are:

- Play the web-based videos (at the beginning of the Learning Lab) and solicit discussion
- Please find the answers in the files, “LDRS 220 FC Unit 2 Balance Sheet Exercise ANSWER KEY” and, “LDRS 220 FC Unit 2 income Statement ANSWER KEY”
- Each student/group may not have the correct answers, so reviewing results as a full group will permit students/groups to revise their work accordingly.
