## Unit 1:  T-Charts, GAAP vs IFRS, and Debits and Credits

This is the intro session that discusses the activities that make up organizational accounting. These basic accounting principles apply to several units. Your primary actions are:

- Review web-based videos at the start of the Learning Lab
- Encourage discussion after videos and activities
 - If a student or team is ‘shy’, offer time for input before you move on
 - This week has lots of personal reflection, so there are no single ‘correct’ answers...no student should think that one type is better or worse than another
