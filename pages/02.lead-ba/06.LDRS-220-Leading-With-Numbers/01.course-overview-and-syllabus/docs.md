### Course Description

This course is a practical study of the leadership application of quantitative reasoning ideas and methods. Emphasis is placed on how leaders use and interpret numbers to make a diverse set of informed decisions.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:

1.	**Knowledge and Application**
 - Use foundational terms and concepts in accounting/financial management methodologies
 - Interpret financial documents (typically monthly or annual reports) to aid in organizational decision making
  - Including the use of ratios to denote trends and health of an organization
 - Assemble and use a basic budget, including variance control
 - Accurately calculate standard deviation, selecting the appropriate formula of ‘population’ or ‘sample’
 - Convert SPC data into the ‘Seven Quality Tools’, reporting the data into a usable format for stakeholders to use for decision making.

2. **Cognitive Complexity**
 - Overcome the challenges of the data collection and reporting to result in ‘valuable’ data that can guide a leader and shape organizational decision making.

3. **Social Responsibility and Global Engagement**
 - Use the power of quantitative analysis to guide an organization, regardless of size. But many organizations have impact within their communities; and this can certainly extend to having global impact.
  - This can include the reporting of the data in a legally compliant and ethical manner

4. **Leadership**
 - Make sound organizational decision based on the results of the quantitative analysis
 - Decisions can sometimes provoke emotions and holding to properly tabulated quantitative analysis can improve the quality of the decisions.

A+ 90-100%  A 85-89%  A- 80-84% | The assignment demonstrates critical, informed, and creative theological inquiry that reflects superior understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student demonstrates depth of insight beyond what is normally expected. Carefully nuanced reasoning and writing, free from material, structural and grammatical error are presupposed in this grade. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B range = Good.**  B+ 77-79%    B 73-76%    B- 70-72%                       | The assignment demonstrates ready command of full range of concepts and shows some critical, informed, and creative inquiry that reflects above average understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student has produced an assignment that is free from material, structural and grammatical errors.                                                    |
