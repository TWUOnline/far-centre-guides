## **Unit 1: Persuasion & Positive Influence**

#### **Activity 1.2: Syllabus Review**

Your facilitator will review the Syllabus during class and answer any questions you may have. Pay close attention to Assignment dates

#### **Activity 1.4: Break Out Sessions (in-class activity)**

During the first class, you will discuss key concepts from the Slideshow and will participate in Break Out Sessions for each topic.

This is a great time of learning from other members of the class. Every team member is *required* to participate in group discussions, meetings, and all written group assignments. Always show respect for all members of the class; both in your speech and manner. Team Leaders will make the effort to engage all participants in your group and provide helpful feedback and support to others.

During discussions, everyone is encouraged to raise thoughtful questions, share ideas, synthesize key points from course texts and discussions, and expand the groupâ€™s perspectives.

**There will be 5 Break Out Sessions.**

Teams will review the following Topics and report on their findings:

1.  What is your vision for LDRS 410?

2.  Leading from above, the side and below.

3.  Informational Approach versus Inspirational Approach.

4.  Four Critical Mindsets to Inspire (ROUND ROBIN).

5.  Rules to Replace Negative with Positive Thoughts.

1.  Social Judgment Theory
