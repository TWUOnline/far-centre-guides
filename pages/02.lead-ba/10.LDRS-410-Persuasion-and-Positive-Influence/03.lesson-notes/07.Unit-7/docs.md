#### ***Activity 7.6: Speed Networking Exercise***

It is time to put what you have learned into practice. The students' goal is to create a comfortable interaction, in which each person shares something about themselves.

Students will move around the room in a “Speed Networking” (similar to “Speed Dating”) format; one on one.

**Facilitator shares** questions (see slide) they can ask each other:
- *How did you choose Trinity Western University?*
- *What organizations do you belong to?*
- *Why did you join these organizations?*
- *What other activities do you participate in?*
- *What are your plans for the next one to two years?*

Students will switch every 2 minutes, until each person has had a chance to meet everyone in the room.

Students will debrief after the speed networking and the Facilitator will invite students to share their reactions answering:

1. *How much did you learn in 2 minutes?*

2. *Did it feel like a conversation?*

3. *Did it get more comfortable as you interviewed people?*

4. *Was it easier to connect with some people?*

5. *What made it easier or more difficult? *

**If time, students can brainstorm about other questions.**

#### ***Activity 7.7: Strategies for Developing your Leadership Network***

Watch the Ted Talk video: [*The Secret to Great Opportunities*](https://www.ted.com/talks/tanya_menon_the_secret_to_great_opportunities_the_person_you_haven_t_met_yet/reading-list).
