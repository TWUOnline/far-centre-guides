#### **Activity 1.2: Syllabus Review**

Your facilitator will review the Syllabus during class and answer any
questions you may have. Pay close attention to Assignment dates

#### **Activity 1.4: Break Out Sessions (in-class activity)**

During the first class, you will discuss key concepts from the
Slideshow and will participate in Break Out Sessions for each topic.

This is a great time of learning from other members of the class. Every
team member is *required* to participate in group discussions, meetings, and all written group assignments. Always show respect for all members of the class; both in your speech and manner. Team Leaders will make the effort to engage all participants in your group and provide helpful feedback and support to others.

During discussions, everyone is encouraged to raise thoughtful
questions, share ideas, synthesize key points from course texts and
discussions, and expand the group’s perspectives.

**There will be 5 Break Out Sessions.**

Teams will review the following Topics and report on their findings:

1.  What is your vision for LDRS 410?

2.  Leading from above, the side and below.

3.  Informational Approach versus Inspirational Approach.

4.  Four Critical Mindsets to Inspire (ROUND ROBIN).

5.  Rules to Replace Negative with Positive Thoughts.

Activity 1.7: Mini Presentation (in-class activity)

In class, the facilitator will divide the class into three teams. Each
team will be assigned the following topics from the article written by
Wrench, Goding, Jonshon, Attias Article (n.d.).

1.  Social Judgment Theory

2.  Cognitive Dissonance Theory

3.  Elaboration Likelihood Model

Teams will create a mini-presentation (no visuals) each taking a turn to
explain what their theory is by role-playing the theory.

Activity 1.8: Case Study

Read the following case study. Which theories of persuasion would help
solve the problems presented? 5 Groups will consider the questions at
the end of the Case Study. (Each group will take
**<span class="underline">one</span>** question 1 through 5). Note that
this is an ungraded learning activity, but is designed to help you
succeed in your assessments for this course.

**Case Study**

[<span class="underline">https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/4985\_Dainton\_Chapter\_5.pdf</span>](https://www.sagepub.com/sites/default/files/upm-binaries/4985_Dainton_Chapter_5.pdf))

## **Unit 2: Persuasion & Positive Influence**

#### Activity 2.1: “Speaking as a Leader”

**In Class Activity:** Ask students to work with a partner using
Humphries (2012) book to share their responses to the questions.
Encourage students to consider the application of these ideas, or
discuss their experiences (e.g. times they have no practiced a speech,
etc.).

#### Activity 2.2: My Listening Skills

Students will share one of the (scored 4 or 5 questions) with the class
on the listening skill they are going to work on.

#### Activity 2.3: Levels of Listening

**Complete the following activities in class:**

(a) **<span class="underline">Break Out Session</span>:**

**Active Listening Skill Set**.

The facilitator will put students in Group. Each Group (1 through 6) is
assigned each active listening <span class="underline">key word</span>
(*Pay attention, Suspend Judgment, Reflect, Clarify, Summarize, and
Share*). After reading Hoppe (2014) students will
<span class="underline">role play</span>, modelling to the class the
meaning of each word assigned.

(b) <span class="underline">**Speed Dating Game**:</span>

**Barriers to Active Listening** (Hoppe, 2014 pg. 13 – 15). How to play:
This Speed Dating session consists of a series of brief one-on-one
interactions between students. After talking with one student for
several minutes, students rotate to another. Students will discuss
briefly the Barriers to Active Listening, (*The Image of Leadership,
Silence as Agreement, External Pressures, Lack of know-how, Individual
Make-up, Time and Place, Emotion, Cultural Differences).*

#### Activity 2.4: Types of Decision-Makers

#### Lab Activity: Role Play

5 Groups will break out and will create a mini-play (5-minute role play)
showing the attributes of the different decision-making types. The
groups will be assigned **one** of the decision-maker types.

Lab Activity: **Beat the Clock**

1\. As a way for students to recall important vocabulary terms, students
will form groups of 4 or 5 to play a game of **Beat the Clock**.

Each group is provided with five blank cards to write the words:
*Charismatic, Skeptic, Thinker, Follower, Controller.* Each group will
also write the definitions on separate sheets of paper provided. One
student in each group volunteers to be the caller and the rest of the
team work together to identify the correct definition. Groups will
exchange cards and definitions. The facilitator will start the timer at
3 mins. The first team to get the words and definitions in order wins.
Team yells “TIME” when they complete the task.

**Note:** Facilitator will provide; Index Cards; felt pens and 8 by 11
paper.

perceive your ideas. It gives you access to the reservations and
objections that others might have. And it deepens your understanding of
the person you’re speaking to.

## Assessment

in 1968. King inspired his audiences telling them; “I have a dream that
my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will
not be judged by the colour of their skin, but by the content of their
character.”

Students divide into tri-ads and will answer the following questions for
class discussion.

1.  What was King’s Grabber?

2.  What was King’s main argument in the speech?

3.  What was the main theme of King’s speech?

Inventione, *written around 50 BC).

Each group will present their Rhetoric definition to the class.

## Assessment

#### Assignment \#3: Elevator Pitch

After you have revised your pitch in class with the help of peer
feedback, you will be asked to deliver your Elevator Pitch with your
partner. One student will be the Pitcher and one will be the Person
being pitched to.

**Be sure to refer to the rubrics for Oral Presentations. (link to
pdf)**

**Facilitator will remind students of Rubrics for Oral Presentations.
Will remind the students to: Take your time, make it conversational,
avoid jargon, be confident.**

Facilitator will record these presentations for marking. Students have
exactly 30 seconds to deliver their pitch. Facilitator will stress the
time frame.

#### Assignment \#4: Persuasion Topic

Remind students: Persuasion Topic due at the beginning of this class.
Please put your Topic name in the Dropbox provided for this Unit. (2%
out of 15%)

# **UNIT 5: Negotiating**

**Note to Facilitator:**

**Since many students may not know the cultural references listed in
Topic 1, brainstorm with students which stars in their culture fit the
descriptions.**

**Choose from the following Lab Activities:**

#### **Activity 5:1: Cross that Line**

Cross That Line works great in any environment, including high school
and even business meetings. Divide your group up into two teams. Each
team picks a team leader. Place the teams on opposite sides of the room
and run a piece of rope down the middle of the room. Players cannot move
to the other team’s side. The leaders stand across from each other
during this game. Each team tries to negotiate with the leader of the
other team to make him move to their side. They can debate, cajole and
even bribe the leader into changing sides. All bribes must be honored by
the team for them to successfully win the game. The other team tries to
negotiate with the other captain, making this game a frantic and an
exciting debate game.

#### **Activity 5:2: Tennis Game**

Tennis is a great metaphor for the art of negotiation. Use this metaphor
to help improve your group’s negotiation skills. Set your team across
from each other at a table. Select a negotiation topic, such as who is
going to pay for the sodas after the meeting. Randomly choose a team to
start. The first team member makes an offer, such as “we’ll pay for 60
percent of the sodas, as long as we get to take half of the bottles in
for a refund.” The player directly across from him on the other team
makes a counter proposal to the player next to the “serving” player as
quickly as possible. This game must be done fast. This player then makes
another proposal to the player across from him. Continue this order
until the very end, when the proposals cycle through again. It continues
cycling until one team accepts the proposal.

**Activity 5:3: Auction Game**

The auction game can give your group a true understanding of the
importance of negotiation. Play this game only in a workplace with
people who can afford to lose a little money. Everyone puts at least $1
in the game pot. After this has finished, players bid on how much they
are going to pay to buy the pot. The twist to this game is that the
highest bidder and the second highest bidder pay the final bid amounts.
However, only the highest bidder wins the money. This game drives
players to negotiate prices with people who are willing to spend money
and either split the pot or get a percentage. Naturally, the second
highest bidder will want to get an equal amount of money, but this is
entirely up to the highest bidder. Players learn the importance of
negotiation in a very short time.

Note that you may want to bring other prizes for the classroom or ask
students to bring something from home. Or use monopoly money.

**Activity 5:4: Charades Game Who am I?**

2 teams of 5 or 6

The charade game allows teams to act out the different types of
negotiators without speaking a word. Team members guess at what
negotiation style the actor is acting out. (King of the Hill, Earnest
and Honest, Linear logical, Emotional Ping Pong, People Pleaser,
Expeditor, Rocking Chair)

#### ***Activity 7.6: Speed Networking Exercise***

It is time to put what you have learned into practice. The students'
goal is to create a comfortable interaction, in which each person shares
something about themselves.

Students will move around the room in a “Speed Networking” (similar to
“Speed Dating”) format; one on one.

**Facilitator shares** questions (see slide) they can ask each other:

  - *How did you choose Trinity Western University?*

  - *What organizations do you belong to?*

  - *Why did you join these organizations?*

  - *What other activities do you participate in?*

  - *What are your plans for the next one to two years?*

Students will switch every 2 minutes, until each person has had a chance
to meet everyone in the room.

Students will debrief after the speed networking and the Facilitator
will invite students to share their reactions answering:

1.  *How much did you learn in 2 minutes?*

2.  *Did it feel like a conversation?*

3.  *Did it get more comfortable as you interviewed people?*

4.  *Was it easier to connect with some people?*

5.  *What made it easier or more difficult? *

**If time, students can brainstorm about other questions.**

#### ***Activity 7.7: Strategies for Developing your Leadership Network***

Activities](https://diversity.missouristate.edu/activities.htm)

## Topic 1: Defining Diversity

#### Activity 7.1: Chain of Diversity (Lab activity)

In the Bible, it clearly states, “I am fearfully and wonderfully made”
(Psalm 139:14). When I first read that scripture, I realized how truly
unique I am. And guess what? You are unique, too. In this first
activity, you will discover and recognize the many ways in which you are
similar and different from each other, and as well how your uniqueness
as an individual.

**Facilitator** (Attach PDF instructions for the game Chain of Diversity
(15 – 20 minute activity)

See Online instructions
[here](https://diversity.missouristate.edu/academic-diversity-activity-chain-of-diversity.htm)

## Topic 2: Stereotyping

#### Activity 7.2: The Perception Game

**Perception Game (10 minutes)**

Begin the exercise be having \[three\] volunteers come to the front,
facing the audience. Each is given one sheet of colored paper. You will
then instruct them to follow your directions exactly as you say. Before
you give the instructions, they must close their eyes.

Advise the students in the audience that no comments can be made on
their behalf. And, laughing is allowed\!

Have the \[students\], with eyes closed, hold their sheets of paper in
front of them. Then instruct them to fold the paper in half; then in
half again. They must then turn the paper x number of times to the right
and left; each time tearing off a piece of paper in the corner. Repeat
this three or four times and end by having the volunteers fold the sheet
in half one more time and tearing off a piece in the middle. During this
whole process, never say specifically which corner to tear.

With their eyes closed, ask them to unfold their sheet of paper while
holding it in front of them. They may then open their eyes, only to
discover that each design is totally different.

**Facilitator asks students answer Round Robin:**

1.  Why is each design totally different?

2.  Did they not have the same instructions?

3.  Didn’t they all follow those instructions?

4.  Then why do we have totally different pieces?

[<span class="underline">http://www.uh.edu/cdi/diversity\_education/resources/activities/pdf/PerceptionGame.pdf</span>](http://www.uh.edu/cdi/diversity_education/resources/activities/pdf/PerceptionGame.pdf)

#### Activity 7:3: First Impressions (10 – 20 minutes)

In the next Activity; the Herman Grid, you will realize we often see
something that does not exist.

**Facilitator:** Students are invited to share their examples of their
scenarios with First Impressions. (see online instructions
[here](https://diversity.missouristate.edu/academic-diversity-activity-first-impressions.htm))
Attach PDFs

#### Activity 7.4: Connect the Dots

In this exercise, students will experience the fact that we often
subconsciously limit our perspectives and alternatives.

In the Connect the Dots activity you will do in your lab, you will be
confronted with a problem to solve and will have to change your
perspectives to solve it.

**Facilitator:** (see PDF for Connect the Dot instructions) Online
instructions
[here](https://diversity.missouristate.edu/academic-diversity-activities-nine-dots.htm).

#### Activity 7.5: Stereotyping

What is stereotyping?

**Facilitator** writes down student’s answers.

As a young child, I was told by my parents to stay away from Catholics.
Growing up in Scotland, Catholic and Protestants often segregated
themselves from each other. I would ride the public transit to school,
and the Catholic children would sit at the back of the bus, and the
Protestant children would sit at the front. We all knew who we were
because of the school jackets we wore\!

Believing Catholics were terrible people, stayed with me for many years
until I finally realized stereotyping is an untrue belief and prejudice
against others. I guess I missed many great opportunities to build
lasting relationships merely because of stereotyping. As leaders, we
must first recognize, stop judging and then correct the errors of our
ways with regards to stereotyping.

Note for Facilitator

**Stereotyping**

In this next activity, students will recognize the widespread use of
stereotypes. Students will engage writing on sheets of paper on the
walls of the room “What they know or what they’ve heard about a
particular group.”

“Each sheet of paper could be titled: Women, Men, Teenagers, African
American Males, Asian Americans, Latino Americans, Catholics,
Christians, Jews, Arabs, Moslems, Amish People, Wealthy People, Poor
People, The Homeless, People on Welfare, People with a physical
challenge, Californians, Southerners, People 75 years and older, People
who live in the Country, People who live in the City, etc. At the end of
the activity, students will discuss stereotypes. We often become
conditioned to think about stereotypes on an almost automatic basis when
we see or hear about someone whose background is different from our own.
We all use stereotypes at one point or another. The important thing is
that we begin to become more conscious of the fact that we are often
thinking “on automatic.”

The goal at the end of this activity is to stop and ask if what we are
thinking is a fact or a stereotype.

(Retrieved from Academic Diversity Activity: What Do You Know or What
Have ....
<https://diversity.missouristate.edu/academic-diversity-activity-know-heard.htm>)

**Facilitator** (see PDF) Upon gathering up wall sheets, the Facilitator
will choose students to read the sheets out loud. The facilitator will
ask the following questions:

1.  What do many of the comments you have written on the lists
    represent?

2.  Are they all true?

3.  Where did they come from? (Responses might include parents, friends,
    teachers, books, the media, and others.)

## Topic 3: Diversity and Intercultural Competence (know-how)

#### Activity 7.6: Case Study

In your Learning Lab, you will participate in analyzing case studies,
using the ideas presented in the text. Be sure to take notes and bring
them to share with your peers.

To promote diversity, the facilitator will Use three different coloured
candies (green, red, blue) to separate students into three groups. Each
group will take a section of the Chapter:

> **Group 1:** Read and report to the class main points on pages 222 –
> 227 of Chapter 9 writing down the key points on the board.
>
> **Group 2**: Read and report to the class main points on pages 228 –
> 234 of Chapter 9 writing down the key points on the board.
>
> **Group 3**: Read and report to the class main points on pages 234 –
> 240 of Chapter 9 writing down the key points on the board.

Next, groups will look at three Case Studies:

> Group 1 Case Study 1
>
> Group 2 Case Study 3
>
> Group 3 Case Study 4

Groups will make a mini presentation on their findings.

## Assessment

**Assignment: Debate Assignment**

**Debate Teams and Topics**

**The class will be divided into debate teams, usually 3 students on
each team. Two teams will debate. The instructor will provide a list of
topic options and each team will defend their point of view.**

**For example:**

> ***Team 1 states*: “The most important characteristic of a good team
> is having a wide variety of backgrounds”.***
>
> ***Team 2 states*: “We believe that a wide variety of backgrounds is
> not the most important characteristic of a good team. We feel that
> being able to get along is the most important”.***

**See Assessment section for notes on Preparation for Debate**

**Facilitator:**

  - Choose Debate Teams.

  - Students will choose and submit their Topic.

  - Topics to choose from are posted on Moodle.

**Assignment: Case Study Assignment**

**See Assessment for details**

Each team will be responsible to evaluate a case study by following the
case study evaluation guidelines (How to Approach Case Studies) given
below. The team will make a presentation to the class and will hand in a
report of their evaluation. The approach to the case study should be
based on the communication: persuasion and positive influence and the
concepts that you have been learning in class.

Important points:

Presentation: The teams must be prepared to answer questions from the
other teams. Each team must prepare 5 questions to ask the team
presenting. Presentations will take place during the last 2 classes.

Report: The report must follow the APA guidelines (includes not
plagiarizing)

1.  Each member of the team must state which topic they completed in the
    report.

2.  The entire report must be a cohesive compilation of all the writing
    done by the members of the team (for example, flow well from one
    point to another).

3.  Report should be between 4-5 pages.

4.  The report is due on the last day of class.

**Facilitator**

  - Teams will be chosen for the Group Case Study Assignment.

  - Students will choose their Case Study. These are posted on Moodle.
