## Course Activities/Requirements:

### In Class Dialogue/Participation

Active participation in group exercises, reflection, and critical discourse is an essential component of this course. You are expected to show respect for all members of the course, both in your speech and actions. Contribute by actively observing and listening, raising thoughtful questions, examining   relevant issues, building on others’ ideas, analyzing and evaluating the   group’s thinking, synthesizing key points, and expanding the group’s  perspectives. Take care not to dominate a conversation, giving space for   others to speak. When in small groups help maintain the focus, flow, and  quality of conversations, and take the initiative to invite others  (particularly those who are quiet) to speak.

| *Never to almost never:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates any contributions in class or small groups, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | *Sometimes to fairly often:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | *Very often to nearly always*: (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others. |

***Note:*** An absence for **one** learning lab will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Journal Response

Throughout this course, you will be invited to write about what you are  learning in a Learning Journal. You should consider your journal as a place  for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and possibly share what you are learning with your community. A learning journal is simply a  record of your thoughts. There is no correct way to create this journal;  rather, it is a reflection of the way you think and the manner in which you > respond to your learning. The purpose of journaling is to make you an active participant in your learning experiences as you engage in the various activities throughout the course’s readings, activities, and discussions with your tutor and your fellow students. Reflecting upon these learning events will help you gain a deeper understanding of the course materials and help integrate your learning into applied practice in your everyday life and work. At the end of each unit, you are asked to write a 400-500 word (1-2 pages double-spaced) response to the questions provided in the unit assessment pages. The journal response will reflect a summary of what you have learned as you have engaged in your weekly learning activities and in-class group   discussions.

### Scientific Management Paper

Write a 4-page response paper to Taylor’s book. Be sure to cite page numbers if you are using quotes (remember that I want to see your understanding of  the quote, not just the quote – use quotes minimally). In your paper address the following questions:

  -   In your own words, what is Scientific Management?

  -   What are 5 principles about Scientific Management that you agree with and why?

  -   What are 5 principles about Scientific Management that you disagree with and why?

  -   What are 3 principles can we learn from Scientific Management that apply to leadership practice today and how will you apply them to your own leadership?

### Leadership Case Studies

At the end of each chapter (except for the introduction) in the Northouse   (2016) book, you will read all three case studies. Choose ONE of the case  studies from EACH assigned chapter and answer the questions for it. Your response to each Case Study should be no more than one page double-spaced (that means, six case studies = 6 pages total). Label each Case Study (i.e. 2.2) and submit all six Case Studies in ONE paper at the end of the last week of the course. Label the computer file with your last name first, i.e. “Smith - Case Studies.” Be sure to include a cover page following the APA guidelines and submit it in the dropbox.
