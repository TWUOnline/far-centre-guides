UNIT NOTES

Unit 1: Transformational Leadership
===================================

Unit 1 Topics: Transformational Leadership Perspective
------------------------------------------------------

We begin Unit 1 by taking an in depth look at seven types of leadership. At the
end of this module, students are expected to know:

-   **(\#1) Transformational leadership (and the 4 “I” s)**

-   **(\#2) Charismatic leadership**

>   *Facilitator: Please note that the 4 “I” s are very important. Students must
>   know them: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual
>   stimulation, and individual consideration.*

-   Transactional Leadership which includes:

    -   (\#3) Contingent reward.

    -   (\#4) Management-by-exception – active.

    -   (\#5) Management-by-exception – passive.

-   *Facilitator: Please stress that (2), (3), and (4) are all transactional
    leadership.*

-   (\#6) Laissez-faire (no leadership).

-   (\#7) Pseudo transformational leadership.

#### Activity 1.4: Discussion Questions

The following are questions that you may be asked in your FAR Centre Facilitated
Learning Lab. To prepare, be sure to read all Unit 1 materials and take notes in
your Reflective Learning Journal. *(Please note that your attendance and
participation in the lab is worth 10% of your total course mark).*

-   Discuss the leadership environment in your workplace (refrain from using the
    names of the organizations to maintain confidentiality.

-   What are some of the positive attributes of your leaders?

-   What are some of the areas of improvement?

-   How can we apply transformational leadership in the respective workplaces?

-   There are three case studies at the end of the text. Please review and
    discuss the two cases that are not case assignment (time permitting).

    *Facilitator: Please explain to the students that Idealized Influence can be
    further subdivided to:*

    -   *Idealized Influence – Attributes (IIA).*

    -   *Idealized influence – Behaviour (IIB).*

*For our purpose, we will stick to the 4 “I” s for now.*

Unit 2: Authentic Leadership
============================

Topics: Authentic Perspective
-----------------------------

We begin Unit 2 by defining authentic leadership. At the end of this module,
students are expected to know:

-   The two approached to authentic leadership (practical and theoretical
    approaches).

>   *Facilitator: Please note that practical approach evolves from real-life
>   experiences, e.g. Nelson Mandela as well as training and development.
>   Theoretical approach is based on findings from social science research.*

-   The five authentic leadership characteristics *(see Figure 9.1 in*
    Northouse*)*:

    1.  Purpose.

    2.  Values

    3.  Relationships.

    4.  Self-discipline.

    5.  Heart.

-   Figure 9.2 is important in becoming an authentic leader. Critical life
    events on its own is not enough to transform a person. There are antecedent
    conditions that the leader should have:

    1.  Positive psychological capacities *(see Table 9.1)*.

        -   confidence.

        -   Hope.

        -   Optimism.

        -   resilience.

    2.  Moral reasoning.

-   Figure 9.2 also presents the four components of authentic leadership *(see
    Figure 9.2 with Table 9.1 integrated)*.

    1.  Self-awareness *(Facilitator: This is related to Emotional Intelligence
        the students will be learning later in this course. It is important that
        students understand that leaders must know himself or herself first.
        This means the students must know who themselves. i.e. They must know
        who they are).*

    2.  Internalized moral perspective *(Facilitator: Please remind the students
        this is related to Chapter 13 – Leadership Ethics).*

    3.  Balanced processing.

    4.  Relational transparency.

Unit 3: Servant Leadership
==========================

#### Activity 3.4: Discussion Questions

-   How can we develop servant leadership in our practices?

    *(Facilitator: Please note that Application on page 243 of the text provides
    some clues to this question).*

Unit 4: Adaptive Leadership
===========================

#### Activity 4.4: Discussion Questions

-   How can you apply adaptive leadership in your family, school, work,
    community, and societal?

>   *(Facilitator: Students usually have a very difficult time distinguishing
>   between adaptive challenge, technical challenge, and technical and adaptive
>   challenge. Please use the questions provided for discussion. Do not give the
>   students the answers until the discussion is complete).*

Unit 5: Followership
====================

Unit 5 Topics: Followership Perspective
---------------------------------------

-   Understand the relationship between followership and destructive leaders.

>   *(Facilitator: This is especially important with students who are in this
>   type of destructive environment).*

#### Activity 5.4: Discussion Questions

The following are questions that you may be asked in your FAR Centre lab. To
prepare, be sure to read all Unit 5 materials and take notes in your Reflective
Learning Journal. *(Please note that your attendance and participation in the
lab is worth 10% of your total course mark).*

-   What is Followership?

-   Based on what you have read about Followership, can you think of some
    examples of Followership you’ve encountered? Please share your experience
    with the class. *(Facilitator: You may use the five follower perspectives
    (p. 306 to 309) as a discussion guide).*

-   Discuss the followership and destructive leader relationship. Can you think
    of yourself (or someone you know) in a situation like this? Please note that
    it can be a personal situation, relationship, home, work, community, or
    country. *(Facilitator: You may use the five follower perspectives (p. 309
    to 313) as a discussion guide).*

-   How can we apply the leader-follower relationship in our family, school,
    work, community, and societal?

>   *(Facilitator: Some students may find themselves in a toxic relationship or
>   maybe even an abusive relationship at home. There is a book by William
>   Mitchell “it’s not What Happened to You, It’s What You Do About It” that is
>   a good read. Also, refer the students to HBR: [6] Bennis & Thomas: Crucibles
>   of Leadership. There are also videos that students can view:*

-   *Best Motivation by the Man with No Arms and No Legs – Nick Vujicic*

Unit 6: Strengths-Based Leadership
==================================

Unit 6 Topics: Strengths-Based Leadership
-----------------------------------------

*Notes for the facilitator: Students might ask you about their weaknesses. This
exercise is about discovering strengths. Please tell the students we are
interested in helping them build their strengths. We all have twenty-four hours
in a day. If we spend an extra half an hour to an hour working with our five
strengths, we will have less time to work on our weaknesses. They can include a
short discussion on their weaknesses in their assignment, but this is not our
emphasis. Besides, they only have two pages to write about their strengths.*

*(Facilitator: Please note that students must do Assignment 6.4c before coming
to class).*

### **Assignment 6c (**lab **activity)**: Student Presentations

Form of a team of (no more and no less than) 3-4 students. Look at the strengths
of your team members and prepare a team presentation in class. The presentation
should be about 5-minutes for each student.

-   Feedback:

>   Each team will receive the same grade for their PowerPoint. The facilitator
>   will assess each student individually based on their presentation.
>   *(Facilitator: You will be given a rubric and each student will be given a
>   grade for their presentation based on the criteria listed). (Facilitator:
>   Please provide students some collective feedback on their presentations. A
>   checklist is provided below. Also, please feel free to add any comments you
>   may have and e-mail them to the professor. Your input is much appreciated.
>   Thank you!).*

-   Checklist:

    -   PowerPoints:

        -   PowerPoints should be point form, not long sentences.

        -   The bullets, numbering, tables, figures, and pictures much be
            consistent in all slides.

        -   The font sizes should be big and yet visually appealing.

    -   Individual Presentation:

        -   Does the student have the appropriate attire? (minimum is business
            casual).

        -   Is the voice projection load enough for the audience at the back of
            the room to hear?

        -   Is the student making eye contact with his audience?

        -   Does the student face the audience? (Not keeping his head down
            reading notes or reading off a cell phone).

        -   Does the student maintain proper posture and movement (e.g. hand
            motions, gestures)?

*Submission instructions:*

*Upload your PowerPoint in your individual assignment Dropbox. Please note that
each student still must upload Assignment 4c individually even though the
PowerPoint is the same for the team.*

[Note to Facilitator: Go over presentation instructions and grading criteria.
Plan for a debrief session with peer/facilitator feedback]
