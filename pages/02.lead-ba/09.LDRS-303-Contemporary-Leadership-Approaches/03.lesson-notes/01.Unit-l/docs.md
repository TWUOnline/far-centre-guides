Unit 1: Transformational Leadership
===================================

Unit 1 Topics: Transformational Leadership Perspective
------------------------------------------------------

We begin Unit 1 by taking an in depth look at seven types of leadership. At the
end of this module, students are expected to know:

-   **(\#1) Transformational leadership (and the 4 “I” s)**

-   **(\#2) Charismatic leadership**

>   *Facilitator: Please note that the 4 “I” s are very important. Students must
>   know them: idealized influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual
>   stimulation, and individual consideration.*

-   Transactional Leadership which includes:

    -   (\#3) Contingent reward.

    -   (\#4) Management-by-exception – active.

    -   (\#5) Management-by-exception – passive.

-   *Facilitator: Please stress that (2), (3), and (4) are all transactional
    leadership.*

-   (\#6) Laissez-faire (no leadership).

-   (\#7) Pseudo transformational leadership.

#### Activity 1.4: Discussion Questions

The following are questions that you may be asked in your FAR Centre Facilitated
Learning Lab. To prepare, be sure to read all Unit 1 materials and take notes in
your Reflective Learning Journal. *(Please note that your attendance and
participation in the lab is worth 10% of your total course mark).*

-   Discuss the leadership environment in your workplace (refrain from using the
    names of the organizations to maintain confidentiality.

-   What are some of the positive attributes of your leaders?

-   What are some of the areas of improvement?

-   How can we apply transformational leadership in the respective workplaces?

-   There are three case studies at the end of the text. Please review and
    discuss the two cases that are not case assignment (time permitting).

    *Facilitator: Please explain to the students that Idealized Influence can be
    further subdivided to:*

    -   *Idealized Influence – Attributes (IIA).*

    -   *Idealized influence – Behaviour (IIB).*

*For our purpose, we will stick to the 4 “I” s for now.*
