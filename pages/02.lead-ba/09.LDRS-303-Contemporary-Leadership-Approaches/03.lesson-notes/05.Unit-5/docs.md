Unit 5: Followership
====================

Unit 5 Topics: Followership Perspective
---------------------------------------

-   Understand the relationship between followership and destructive leaders.

>   *(Facilitator: This is especially important with students who are in this
>   type of destructive environment).*

#### Activity 5.4: Discussion Questions

The following are questions that you may be asked in your FAR Centre lab. To
prepare, be sure to read all Unit 5 materials and take notes in your Reflective
Learning Journal. *(Please note that your attendance and participation in the
lab is worth 10% of your total course mark).*

-   What is Followership?

-   Based on what you have read about Followership, can you think of some
    examples of Followership you’ve encountered? Please share your experience
    with the class. *(Facilitator: You may use the five follower perspectives
    (p. 306 to 309) as a discussion guide).*

-   Discuss the followership and destructive leader relationship. Can you think
    of yourself (or someone you know) in a situation like this? Please note that
    it can be a personal situation, relationship, home, work, community, or
    country. *(Facilitator: You may use the five follower perspectives (p. 309
    to 313) as a discussion guide).*

-   How can we apply the leader-follower relationship in our family, school,
    work, community, and societal?

>   *(Facilitator: Some students may find themselves in a toxic relationship or
>   maybe even an abusive relationship at home. There is a book by William
>   Mitchell “it’s not What Happened to You, It’s What You Do About It” that is
>   a good read. Also, refer the students to HBR: [6] Bennis & Thomas: Crucibles
>   of Leadership. There are also videos that students can view:*
