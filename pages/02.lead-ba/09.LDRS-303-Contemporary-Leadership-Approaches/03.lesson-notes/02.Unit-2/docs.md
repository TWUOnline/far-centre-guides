Unit 2: Authentic Leadership
============================

Topics: Authentic Perspective
-----------------------------

We begin Unit 2 by defining authentic leadership. At the end of this module,
students are expected to know:

-   The two approached to authentic leadership (practical and theoretical
    approaches).

>   *Facilitator: Please note that practical approach evolves from real-life
>   experiences, e.g. Nelson Mandela as well as training and development.
>   Theoretical approach is based on findings from social science research.*

-   The five authentic leadership characteristics *(see Figure 9.1 in*
    Northouse*)*:

    1.  Purpose.

    2.  Values

    3.  Relationships.

    4.  Self-discipline.

    5.  Heart.

-   Figure 9.2 is important in becoming an authentic leader. Critical life
    events on its own is not enough to transform a person. There are antecedent
    conditions that the leader should have:

    1.  Positive psychological capacities *(see Table 9.1)*.

        -   confidence.

        -   Hope.

        -   Optimism.

        -   resilience.

    2.  Moral reasoning.

-   Figure 9.2 also presents the four components of authentic leadership *(see
    Figure 9.2 with Table 9.1 integrated)*.

    1.  Self-awareness *(Facilitator: This is related to Emotional Intelligence
        the students will be learning later in this course. It is important that
        students understand that leaders must know himself or herself first.
        This means the students must know who themselves. i.e. They must know
        who they are).*

    2.  Internalized moral perspective *(Facilitator: Please remind the students
        this is related to Chapter 13 â€“ Leadership Ethics).*

    3.  Balanced processing.

    4.  Relational transparency.
