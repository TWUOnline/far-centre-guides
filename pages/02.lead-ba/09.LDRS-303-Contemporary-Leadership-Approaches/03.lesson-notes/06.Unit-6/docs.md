Unit 6: Strengths-Based Leadership
==================================

Unit 6 Topics: Strengths-Based Leadership
-----------------------------------------

*Notes for the facilitator: Students might ask you about their weaknesses. This
exercise is about discovering strengths. Please tell the students we are
interested in helping them build their strengths. We all have twenty-four hours
in a day. If we spend an extra half an hour to an hour working with our five
strengths, we will have less time to work on our weaknesses. They can include a
short discussion on their weaknesses in their assignment, but this is not our
emphasis. Besides, they only have two pages to write about their strengths.*

*(Facilitator: Please note that students must do Assignment 6.4c before coming
to class).*

### **Assignment 6c (**lab **activity)**: Student Presentations

Form of a team of (no more and no less than) 3-4 students. Look at the strengths
of your team members and prepare a team presentation in class. The presentation
should be about 5-minutes for each student.

-   Feedback:

>   Each team will receive the same grade for their PowerPoint. The facilitator
>   will assess each student individually based on their presentation.
>   *(Facilitator: You will be given a rubric and each student will be given a
>   grade for their presentation based on the criteria listed). (Facilitator:
>   Please provide students some collective feedback on their presentations. A
>   checklist is provided below. Also, please feel free to add any comments you
>   may have and e-mail them to the professor. Your input is much appreciated.
>   Thank you!).*

-   Checklist:

    -   PowerPoints:

        -   PowerPoints should be point form, not long sentences.

        -   The bullets, numbering, tables, figures, and pictures much be
            consistent in all slides.

        -   The font sizes should be big and yet visually appealing.

    -   Individual Presentation:

        -   Does the student have the appropriate attire? (minimum is business
            casual).

        -   Is the voice projection load enough for the audience at the back of
            the room to hear?

        -   Is the student making eye contact with his audience?

        -   Does the student face the audience? (Not keeping his head down
            reading notes or reading off a cell phone).

        -   Does the student maintain proper posture and movement (e.g. hand
            motions, gestures)?

*Submission instructions:*

*Upload your PowerPoint in your individual assignment Dropbox. Please note that
each student still must upload Assignment 4c individually even though the
PowerPoint is the same for the team.*

[Note to Facilitator: Go over presentation instructions and grading criteria.
Plan for a debrief session with peer/facilitator feedback]
