## Unit 1:  Leadership, Service and Jesus: An Introduction

Review the syllabus with students and encourage them to please follow the suggested due dates. “The due dates in this course are meant to "chunk" the course into manageable parts so that you are successful. Feel free to ‘go ahead’ but please don’t get behind. Sometimes life throws us challenges and set-backs and we might need to take a day away from the course, but please do your best to catch up the very next day. In an asynchronous environment it behooves us all to manage our time so that posts are up on time and ready to be responded to. This will avoid frustration for everyone!”

**Course Cafe**
Plan icebreaker activity based on Course Café introductions (e.g. peer interview)

*Activity 1.4: Comparing Models of Leadership*
See Moodle for instructions. Let students know whether this will be a full lab activity, or whether they should start/complete their sketch note at home.
