## Unit 5: Trait Approach

At this point in the course, the gears shift from a historical account of leadership and management ideas to more contemporary approaches.  In this unit, students will begin by exploring transactional approaches to leadership which are typically those that focus on the leader.  Specifically, this unit examines the Trait Approach. These are the activities students are expected to complete before coming to class:

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Case Study Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the learning lab after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 5, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1. Discuss the importance of the following traits associated with leaders: intelligence, self-confidence, determination, integrity, and sociability. Is this list all-inclusive?

  2. Choose one of the main traits associated with leaders. Identify one or two people who have this trait. How does it serve them in their leadership role?

  3. Discuss which of the “Big Five” personality traits you feel you possess and give a personal example of how they benefited you in a leadership context.

  4. How big of an impact do you think emotional intelligence has on helping people be successful? Give a personal example of its impact on your life.

  5. Is charisma an inborn trait or can it be acquired later on in life? How might a person acquire charisma?

  6. Why do people’s perceptions of leaders matter? How does perception fit with the process nature of leadership? How does it fit with the influential nature of leadership?

  7. What are some leadership challenges today? (e.g., economic policy, climate change, and world hunger). Which of the leadership traits from this chapter are most relevant to address that challenge?

  8. Are there any leadership traits needed by leaders today that aren’t listed in chapter 2? If so, what do you think is missing?

### Part 2: Case Study Activity

Divide the class up into three different groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the case studies provided at the end of Chapter 2. As a group, have the students read the case study together and answer the questions prepared at the end of the case study to guide discussion.

  -   Each group will be responsible for leading the discussion with the guiding questions provided at the end of the case study.

  -   Teamwork and communication are key aspects of this exercise. If needed, call on students who haven’t spoken yet or instigate another rule to encourage participation.

  -   Each group will be responsible for recording key pieces of information discussed in the group.

  -   Write out key facts on the board for reference.

  -   Having the information written out makes it easier for students to reference during the discussion and helps maintain everyone on the same page. 

  -   Keep an eye on the clock and make sure students are moving through the case study and questions at a reasonable pace.

  -   Allow students to work on the case study and questions for 1 hour and then have students re-cap the key ideas discussed and present this information to the class in the last 30 minutes.

  -   The re-cap should highlight the key points from the discussion. Make sure to compare and contrast alternate viewpoints that came up during the discussion and emphasize the take-home messages that can be applied to future situations.

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each learning lab and then providing a score for each student at the end of the learning lab based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| N*ever to almost never:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates any contributions in class or small groups, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | S*ometimes to fairly often:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | *Very often to nearly always*: (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others. |
***Note:*** An absence for **one** learning lab will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the learning lab is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response which includes writing a 400-500 word (1-2 pages double spaced) response to questions provided in the Unit 5 assessment page.

Next, they need to provide a case study response. They are asked to choose ONE of the case studies that interests them from Chapter 2 and answer the questions for it that are provided at the end of the case.

They will record their response to the Case Study questions in a Word document or a Google document. The response should be no more than one page double-spaced. Label this Case Study 1. Keep this word document in a file folder on your computer because you will be adding to the document over the next 5 units. This case study response is part 1 of 6.
