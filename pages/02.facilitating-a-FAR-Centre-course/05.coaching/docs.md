Assessments in FAR Centres are graded by TWU faculty. FAR Centre Facilitators may need to guide students in understanding assessments, interpreting feedback, and identifying areas of improvement. Please refer to specific course rubrics for more details on Assessment.  Below are come key principles in Assessment that will guide you as you facilitate your courses.

Assessment is the systematic collection of information about students’abilities, characteristics, skills, understanding and knowledge.

Assessment can be used:

  - for learning,

  - to improve instruction

  - to allow learners to control their own learning

  - to mirror real world expectations

Formative assessment is very effective in both pedagogy and andragogy. While the traditional purpose of classroom assessment has long been summative - reporting on what has occurred after the teaching and learning process, the educator also needs to be interested in formative assessment - gathering data while teaching and learning are occurring.

Formative assessment fosters learners who are self-directed and must be relevant, frequent and motivating to learners. Formative Assessment provides information to learners during
instruction, before instruction has been completed. It allows learners to judge their own ongoing learning and progress, monitor, control, and improve their own learning. By using formative assessment methods instructors are able to gather information to modify their instruction, change course, or alter strategy while learning is still taking place.

Formative instruction is not about grades, it’s about learning. An example of assessment as learning is the peer review process. By critically engaging with another’s work and giving substantive feedback, learners have the opportunity to respond from a learning stance.

Consider how you can give your students formative feedback on assessments throughout the course.
