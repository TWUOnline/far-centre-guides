Assessments in FAR Centres are graded by TWU faculty. FAR Centre Facilitators may need to guide students in understanding assessments, interpreting feedback, and identifying areas of improvement. Please refer to specific course rubrics for more details on Assessment.  Below are come key principles in Assessment that will guide you as you facilitate your courses.

Assessment is the systematic collection of information about students’abilities, characteristics, skills, understanding and knowledge.

Assessment can be used:

  - for learning,

  - to improve instruction

  - to allow learners to control their own learning

  - to mirror real world expectations

Formative assessment is very effective in both pedagogy and andragogy. While the traditional purpose of classroom assessment has long been summative - reporting on what has occurred after the teaching and learning process, the educator also needs to be interested in formative assessment - gathering data while teaching and learning are occurring.

Formative assessment fosters learners who are self-directed and must be relevant, frequent and motivating to learners. Formative Assessment provides information to learners during
instruction, before instruction has been completed. It allows learners to judge their own ongoing learning and progress, monitor, control, and improve their own learning. By using formative assessment methods instructors are able to gather information to modify their instruction, change course, or alter strategy while learning is still taking place.

Formative instruction is not about grades, it’s about learning. An example of assessment as learning is the peer review process. By critically engaging with another’s work and giving substantive feedback, learners have the opportunity to respond from a learning stance.

Consider how you can give your students formative feedback on assessments throughout the course.

In addition to course and unit learning outcomes, FAR Centre courses align with TWU's Student Learning Outcomes. As a Facilitator, please review all outcomes of your courses and be sure to address these with your students.

## TWU Student Learning Outcomes

Trinity Western is a Christian, liberal arts University. As a
***Christian*** university, Trinity Western is grounded in the
historical Christian tradition and seeks to unite reason and faith
through teaching and scholarship. As a ***liberal arts*** university,
Trinity Western prepares students to deal with complexity, diversity,
and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world
and helping them to develop transferable intellectual and practical
skills.

The Student Learning Outcomes pertain to the whole University but it is
recognized that they apply most directly to the undergraduate
experience. The University’s graduate programs are diverse and highly
specialized and thus support the University student learning outcomes
through curricula which are appropriate to those specializations and the
nature of the degrees offered.

It is intended that through the range of their experiences at Trinity
Western University, students should prepare for a life of learning and
service by developing:

**KNOWLEDGE AND ITS APPLICATION**
  - a broad foundational knowledge of human culture and the physical and
    natural world.
  - a depth of understanding in any chosen field(s) of study.
  - applied knowledge acquired through discipline-appropriate experiential learning.


**COGNITIVE COMPLEXITY**
  - skills including: critical and creative thinking, quantitative and
    qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information
    literacy.
  - an ability to articulate various interdisciplinary and multi-disciplinary perspectives, integrating informed Christian perspectives.
  - an ability to respond with wisdom, humility and charity to questions, issues, and problems of the human condition.

**AESTHETIC EXPRESSION AND INTERPRETATION**
  - creative, performative, material and narrative forms of critical inquiry.
  - intuitive, imaginative and interpretive methodologies.
  - ways of knowing through which maker and receiver come to insight and understanding.

**INTER-AND INTRA-PERSONAL WELLNESS**
  - a holistic awareness of their personhood, purpose, and calling within the context of the communities in which they live and study.
  - personal and social health.
  - an appreciation of the role of community in wellness.

**SPIRITUAL FORMATION**
  - a spiritual dimension by means of an exposure to a reflective and caring Christ-centred community which encourages:
      - *a further understanding of God.*
      - *a discovery of a deep and personal spiritual foundation.*
      - *an embodiment of a Christ-like way of life characterized by love for and service to others.*

**SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT**
  - the resources, skills, and motivation to become engaged global citizens who serve locally, nationally, and globally in socially and economically just ways.
  - a commitment to informed and ethical reasoning.
  - respect for the dignity and rights of all persons.
