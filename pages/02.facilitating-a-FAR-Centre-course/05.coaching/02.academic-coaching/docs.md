A significant part of the facilitator's role will be to provide academic coaching for FAR centre students. Coaching can happen with a group of students or one-on-one, and both situations require facilitators to consider the following principles and best practices. These notes have been taken from TWU's Coaching Manual used by the university's learning coaches.

The definition of a "coach" is someone who "meets students where they are at and provides direction, encouragement, correction, and wisdom to help the students become all they can be. The coach is process-focused, not product-focused. It is relational, not clinical. A coach is not an editor or tutor, not a "fixer" or a doctor. Coaches support the scholarly development of learners as they work on specific tasks, with clear targets"(Coaching Manual, p.1).

As noted above, the role of the coach is not to as simple as helping students with their homework. Coaches have a wider scope of the learning process than tutors do, and their goal is to come along side students and strategically move them towards becoming  **self-regulated learners**. Self-regulated learners are those who learn by choice with determination and agency, and the goal of the learning coach is to help students become self-regulated learners through developing in them these three things:

- Competence the sense of having control over one's environment, not being a victim or helpless
- Relatedness- being in relationship with others, being valued and cared for, which leads to a freedom to take risks in learning
- Autonomy- being able to make one's own decisions and do things independently, motivated by a sense of value and pleasure in learning.


To coach in a way that promotes self-regulated learning, consider these specific strategies:

-	Give students choices and when choices are restricted, discuss why
-	Use inviting language, such as “I’m interested in your idea. Can you tell me more about it?”
-	Be in tune to the learner’s personal state during a session and adapt accordingly (Reeve, 2006; as cited in Moreno-Murcia, 2016).
-	Do not shut down a student’s perspective or thought. Lead the student to ask themselves questions and seek more clarity on it.
-	Do not pressure the learner to accept your thought or perspective
-	Provide structure for each session. Help the learner understand the expectations for being successful in your sessions.
-	Encourage the learner to evaluate his or her sources of support, whether material or human
-	Welcome complaints and negative affect. Validate these emotions.
-	Never use guilt or shame tactics.

**Self-regulated learning through meta-cognitive skills**

The learning coach guide suggests that "student progress towards self-regulated learning is related to the ability to analyze and articulate their own learning and learning tasks"(p.8). With that in mind, facilitators recognize that this ability develops over time, and therefore they should use the coaching sessions as an opportunity for students practice this type of critical thinking and analysis about their own learning.

Facilitators can do this through asking students to talk to them about the essays they have worked on and the feedback they have been given by their instructors. Because the students will be practicing meta-language in their English and writing classes, the facilitators will be building upon what they are already learning in their classes, yet students may feel safer exploring new ways of thinking and reflecting on their work in a more personalized space with a learning coach.

It is crucial that coaching sessions focus on the process rather than the product. While facilitators will be helping students maximize the quality of their final assignments, the goal of the facilitator/coach is to impart tools and thinking skills to learners so that they know how to regulate their own learning in the future. Students who are not confident in their own problem-solving skills will likely struggle to achieve successful final products.

### **Coaching for Social Competency**

There is also a social component to coaching, as coaches can offer emotional and social support to students in the midst of the many stressful transitions they face when they begin their programs. According to a study done by Mellard and Hazel(1992), these are some domains of social competency that educators can assess:

1. Language – “understanding others and making oneself understood”

2. Pragmatics – interpreting a social situation, understanding expectations, interpreting comments as positive or negative

3. Humor – realizing when someone is joking

4. Personal-social involvement – participating in social activities and going out with friends

5. Peer relations – how well other people get along with you; whether or not people avoid you

6. Helpfulness – understanding other people’s feelings and needs; understanding your own

7. Applied academics – functioning in everyday life, such as filling out forms and comparing prices

8. Money management – understanding costs, budgeting, making payments

9. Coping – responding to stress and challenges, such as criticisms, changes in routine, expectations, and pressure

10. Time management – scheduling and prioritizing

11. Personal responsibility – knowing personal information, organizing yourself, keeping appointments, etc.

12. Goal setting – organizing tasks, recognizing the need for help or resources, solving problems

Students may be more developed in some domains than others, and socially competent individuals will vary on the spectrum of each domain. That is why it important for facilitators to dialogue with their students to get to know who they are and how they function. While it is not a coach's job to provide mental health counseling for a student, they can refer them to a counselor or get them connected to needed resources.

### **Stages of Coaching**

Because coaching is process-oriented, it can be helpful for coaches to approach their sessions with sequential stages in mind. The process may not be as linear as what is laid out here, but it can be a useful framework to reference for coaches as they design their sessions.

When you strategize a development plan for your students, you can refer to these stages as you see fit.

### **Guidelines for best practices**

Here is a very brief summary of practical tips and considerations you should keep in mind when you go about your coaching.

*Principles to coach by*:

* No editing- only suggest what the student should edit
* No online feedback on drafts- only face-to-face
* digital communication is fine for questions or conversations

*How to look at a student's paper*:

* Read the assignment from the professor and ask the students if they feel they have addressed these requirements. Ask a lot of questions and suggest that the student clarify with the professor.

* Check the big picture – whether the assignment meets the requirements. (Forexample, if the assignment is a research paper, does the student use research? Does it include all the required sections? Is it working towards a suitable length?

* Reading #1 – read it without stopping or making notes to get a sense of the flow of the essay and whether it meets the assignment requirements and whether it is the student’s own work

* Reading #2 -  read it for logic and cohesion, using a highlighter to identify keywords throughout. Help the student visualize whether the parts fit together ornot.

* Reading #3 – read it for evidence to determine whether the student has used the right kind of evidence and sufficient evidence. Use questioning to help the reader discover gaps, mis-matched research, and weak integration of research. Discuss the kind of evidence they need (according to the assignment itself, the discipline, and the genre).

* Reading #4 – read it for sentence-level recommendations. Point out all the sections in which you cannot understand due to grammar and ask the learnerto explain the meaning to you. Identify wrong uses of words and ask the student to explain his or her meaning. Suggest a few options but allow the student to choose. Point out the students’ most common problem areas for grammar and ask the student how to correct them. DO NOT PICK UP THE PEN AND CORRECT EVERYTHING YOURSELF.

* Final step:  ask student what the rules are for formatting, use of documentation, and references page. Lead the student to tell you what he or she knows and direct them to the resources that are available to them, such as their coursepack or Purdue’s OWL.

* When the student receives the assignment back with the instructor’s feedback, ask the student to read the feedback out loud and explain what they think it means. Together, come up with goals for the next assignment.
