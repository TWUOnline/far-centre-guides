### Facilitating a FAR Centre Course

# Key Principles for Facilitation
Below are some key reminders for you as you plan and deliver lessons in the FAR Centres. Refer also to your resources and course material from LDRS 627, 662, 663, 664, and 667.


### Androgogy
As you plan your learning activities, keep in mind these six assumptions about andragogy from Knowles (1980 cited in Merriam & Bierma, 2014, p.47)

1.  As a person matures, his or her self-concept moves from that of a
    dependent personality toward one of a **self-directing** human being.

2.  An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of **experience**, which is a
    rich resource for learning.

3.  The readiness of an adult to learn is closely related to the
    developmental tasks of his or her social role.

4.  There is a change in time perspective as people mature – from future
    application of knowledge to immediacy of **application**. Thus, an adult
    is more problem than subject centered in learning.

5.  Adults are mostly driven by **internal motivation**, rather than
    external motivators.

6.  Adults need to know the **reason** for learning something.


### Prior Needs Assessment
Before you plan to teach anything, it’s a good idea to find out what
your students already know.  You can save time (and boredom) by not
spending time on topics or skills that they already know and instead
plan to enhance their knowledge and take them further.  This is a much
more motivating approach and one that adults will appreciate.  A prior
needs assessment is not always a "quiz" though – it can be a discussion,
a concept map, a KWL (Know, Want to Know, Learned), a ‘Minute Paper’…..
The idea is to plan a way to learn what the participants already know on
the topic. Because they are adults it’s important to recognize their
prior life experience.
