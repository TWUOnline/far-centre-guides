Each FAR center will have a different schedule for different sets of courses they are offering. However, it will be important for you as a facilitator to understand the expectations of you once you arrive on your FAR Center campus. You will be required to lead Learning Labs for each course that run for about 3 hours, once or twice a week. During these labs, you will facilitate activities that correspond with the facilitation guides provided by the instructor, but as you get to know the students, you will know how to design your learning labs. If times correspond, you may want to see I you can have the instructor zoom in once or twice in the semester for introductions and so the students have a reference for who their instructor is. If this isn’t possible, you can use pre-recorded videos of the instructor to watch during the labs.

The learning labs will be for group activities, but a part from those assigned times, you will want to create space in your schedule to be your designated “office hours” where students can drop by if they need one-on-one. Some students may need extra assistance and you can use this time to look over individual assignments and learn more in-depth about who they are.
