When designing your activities your goal should be to enable students to be as successful as they can be. We want to give students meaningful opportunities to demonstrate
learning. Note that there may be undiagnosed learning disabilities, cross cultural differences and English language learning that may impact student learning.  See the following resources to support students:

>> #### Learning Disabilities

  - Refer students to the [Steps to attaining disability services at
    TWU](https://www.twu.ca/wellness-centre/disabilities-and-equity-access/steps-attaining-disability-services)

>> #### English Language Learning

  - Refer students to the [TWU Writing
    Centre](https://www.twu.ca/student-life/student-success/writing-centre)
