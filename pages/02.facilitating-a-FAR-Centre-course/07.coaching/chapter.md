# Our goal:

Learning Coaches lead university (graduate and undergraduate) students
in developing academic and linguistic confidence with the ultimate goal
of fostering metacognition, self-awareness, and independence.

Grolnick and Raftery-Helmer (2015) describe the kind of learner we hope
to see: “Proactive, self-regulated learners are problem solvers: They
seek out information, take steps to master material, and persist when
tasks are challenging” (p. 252).

# Definition of a coach:

A coach meets students where they are at and provides direction,
encouragement, correction, and wisdom to help the students become all
they can be. The work of a coach is process-focused, not
product-focused. It is relational, not clinical. A coach is not an
editor or tutor, not a “fixer” or a doctor. Coaches support the
scholarly development of learners as they work on specific tasks, with
clear targets.

According to Wang (2013), coaching draws on Vygotsky’s concept of “the
zone of proximal development” and scaffolding in that it assumes:

1.  The essentially dialogic nature of discourse in which knowledge is
    co-constructed;

2.  The significance of the authentic and cognitively challenging tasks
    in which it is embedded;

3.  The role of social mediation and the establishment of
    inter-subjectivity as shared understandings between learners and
    teachers;

4.  The transfer of responsibility for the task to the students as the
    major goal (p. 38).

# Towards self-regulated learning

*Self-regulated learning* (SRL) is a term that helps us understand
students who are active, who “learn with volition and agency” (Grolnick
& Raftery-Helmer, 2015). In contrast, students who are not
self-regulated tend to blame others for their failures because they
perceive a threat. Research in SRL has found that there are educational
strategies to increase the atmosphere for SRL.

A related theory is Self-determination theory, which states that
everyone has needs for “competence, relatedness, and autonomy. According
to this perspective, the satisfaction of these needs is essential for
well-being, whereas their thwarting results in a disturbance of
functioning” (Grolnick & Raftery-Helmer, 2015, p. 254).

  - Competence – the sense of having control over one’s environment, not
    being a victim or helpless.

  - Relatedness – being in relationship with others, being valued and
    cared for, which leads to a feeling of freedom to take risks in
    learning

  - Autonomy – being able to make one’s own decisions and do things
    independently, motivated by a sense of value and pleasure in
    learning

Holec (1980) is widely quoted in his definition of autonomy: “to say of
a learner that he is autonomous is to say that he is capable of taking
charge of his own learning” (as cited in Schmenk, 2005).

The constructivist model of learning sees knowledge as it is constructed
and negotiated by the learner. “In these environments of interaction,
the teacher becomes the learning facilitator, planning tasks and
supporting responsibility for learning (Koç, 2006), providing students
with options, helping them make their own decisions and solve problems
for themselves. Consequently, this new focus provides students with
opportunities to ask their own questions, and create their own learning
concepts and strategies based on existing knowledge. The teacher has to
accept students’ autonomy and their enterprising spirit, and support
them in this sense.” (Moreno-Murcia, 2016).

A question to consider is whether “learner autonomy” is a cultural
concept. Is it something we can reasonably and fairly expect of our
global students? What do we need to do to lead our students toward
autonomy?

How can our programs create an environment that fosters self-regulated
learning? According to Grolnick and Raftery-Helmer (2015), programs need
to focus on supporting autonomy, not control, on a structured
environment that can lead to competence, and on relationships that
encourage participation.

  - Autonomy-building – through our interactions with students so that
    we ask for and value their opinions, perspectives, and initiatives

  - Relatedness – through demonstrating love by giving our time and
    focused attention, and through recognizing emotion as valid

<!-- end list -->

  - Competence – through clear and consistent rules, policies,
    expectations, and consequences, , and through helping the learners
    figure out how to be successful and avoid failure in this new
    cultural and educational context; our programs should give
    opportunity for the learners to influence the curriculum and the
    learning environment (See Benson (1997) for concepts of technical,
    psychological, and political autonomy).

Therefore, the primary goal of Learning Coaches is to invest time in
building a relationship with each student. The goal of this relationship
is trust, not dependency.

Wang (2013) writes, “In a coaching relationship, it is very important
for the coach to model and provide good feedback for the person being
coached… However, feedback cannot happen without trust and safety.
Establishing rapport and connection is important at the beginning as
well as maintaining this trust through the coaching process. (p. 46).

**Specific Strategies for Self-Regulated Learning**

  - Give students choices and when choices are restricted, discuss why

  - Use inviting language, such as “I’m interested in your idea. Can you
    tell me more about it?”

  - Be in tune to the learner’s personal state during a session and
    adapt accordingly (Reeve, 2006; as cited in Moreno-Murcia, 2016).

  - Do not shut down a student’s perspective or thought. Lead the
    student to ask themselves questions and seek more clarity on it.

  - Do not pressure the learner to accept your thought or perspective

  - Provide structure for each session. Help the learner understand the
    expectations for being successful in your sessions.

  - Encourage the learner to evaluate his or her sources of support,
    whether material or human

  - Welcome complaints and negative affect. Validate these emotions.

  - Never use guilt or shame tactics.

# Social Competency

The transition to university is risky and stressful. For students in our
programs (global students, students with undeveloped academic skills or
learning disabilities), the first year can be even more challenging. The
Learning Coach, in working out of the foundation of relationship, has a
role in walking with students through the social demands of this
transition.

According to a study by Mellard and Hazel (1992), social competency can
be examined by looking at the following domains:

1.  Language – “understanding others and making oneself understood”

2.  Pragmatics – interpreting a social situation, understanding
    expectations, interpreting comments as positive or negative

3.  Humor – realizing when someone is joking

4.  Personal-social involvement – participating in social activities and
    going out with friends

5.  Peer relations – how well other people get along with you; whether
    or not people avoid you

6.  Helpfulness – understanding other people’s feelings and needs;
    understanding your own

7.  Applied academics – functioning in everyday life, such as filling
    out forms and comparing prices

8.  Money management – understanding costs, budgeting, making payments

9.  Coping – responding to stress and challenges, such as criticisms,
    changes in routine, expectations, and pressure

10. Time management – scheduling and prioritizing

11. Personal responsibility – knowing personal information, organizing
    yourself, keeping appointments, etc.

12. Goal setting – organizing tasks, recognizing the need for help or
    resources, solving problems

Our students may struggle in one or more of these domains. It is not the
role of the Learning Coach is to teach them the skills. According to
Mellard & Hazel (1992), although it may be true in some cases that the
learner has never acquired the skill, the weakness may be related to the
absence of motivation to use the skill or paralysis due to “competing
emotional responses such as anxiety” (p. 266).

The Learning Coach may attempt to dialogue with the student to try to
understand the cause, but in many cases, the Learning Coach can refer
the student to the Student Success Centre or a Counselor.

# The Daily Work of the Learning Coach

Learning Coaches should not focus on correcting grammar. Rather, this
sentence-level focus should come as a *final step* of support in all
written assignments. The coach might help students develop their
grammatical accuracy and their lexical range through targeting key
errors and key structures (see Grammar Syllabus), but all discussion of
sentence-level language should work towards *learner development* rather
than editing or “cleaning up” an essay.

The work of the learning coach might involve:

# Meta-cognition and the Role of the Learning Coach

Student progress towards self-regulated learning is related to the
ability to analyze and articulate their own learning and learning tasks.

**Process**

Wismath, Orr & MacKay (2015) analyze different “thresholds” during
problem-solving learning. Students need time to reach each threshold.
They report that students in their study needed to discover on their own
that learning requires persistence.

The Learning Coach sessions should reinforce meta-cognitive skills by
re-using the terms and by asking students to talk through their own
essays as well as the feedback from the professor. Students have learned
(or are learning) meta-language in their WRTG and ENGL courses, so this
becomes a shared meta-language when the learning coach sessions employ
it, too.

The Learning Coach sessions are weekly safe places for practicing the
kinds of thinking and analysis the students are beginning to build. This
highlights again that the nature of the Learning Coach work should not
be end product-focused: “Modeling metacognitive discussion in
\[sessions\], and requiring metacognitive reflection by students on
assignments, can promote an increasing awareness of problem solving as a
journey and not a destination or answer only. Allowing students to
figure out how to learn from their mistakes can also enhance an
appreciation of the process of problem solving, rather than the process
of getting a quick right answer” (Wismath, Orr & MacKay, 2015).

**Understanding the disciplines**

During Learning Coach interactions, there will be many opportunities to
discuss similarities and differences between the various disciplines the
students are engaged in. The Learning Coach should lead the student to
discover how to be successful in each discipline by asking them
questions and drawing their attention to specific features (such as the
use of statistics in social science or primary sources in history).

# Guidelines for best practices:

Learning Coaches are guided by ASKING QUESTIONS and LISTENING. Their
role is not to tell or *control* the learning environment. They should
not give the student ideas, impose their own ideas on students, tell
them what to write, or fix things. Most of the time, the “pen” (whether
literal or digital) should be in the hand of the student.

**Considering these principles, the Learning Coach follows these
parameters:**

  - No editing

  - No online feedback on drafts – only face-to-face (with occasional
    exceptions in extenuating circumstances)

  - Digital communication is fine for questions or conversation, such as
    discussing a thesis statement

**Process for looking at a paper:**

  - Read the assignment from the professor and ask the students if they
    feel they have addressed these requirements. Ask a lot of questions
    and suggest that the student clarify with the professor.

  - Check the big picture – whether the assignment meets the
    requirements. (For example, if the assignment is a research paper,
    does the student use research? Does it include all the required
    sections? Is it working towards a suitable length?

  - Reading \#1 – read it without stopping or making notes to get a
    sense of the flow of the essay and whether it meets the assignment
    requirements and whether it is the student’s own work

  - Reading \#2 - read it for logic and cohesion, using a highlighter to
    identify key words throughout. Help the student visualize whether
    the parts fit together or not.

  - Reading \#3 – read it for evidence to determine whether the student
    has used the right kind of evidence and sufficient evidence. Use
    questioning to help the reader discover gaps, mis-matched research,
    and weak integration of research. Discuss the kind of evidence they
    need (according to the assignment itself, the discipline, and the
    genre).

  - Reading \#4 – read it for sentence-level recommendations. Point out
    all the sections in which you cannot understand due to grammar and
    ask the learner to explain the meaning to you. Identify wrong uses
    of words and ask the student to explain his or her meaning. Suggest
    a few options but allow the student to choose. Point out the
    students’ most common problem areas for grammar and ask the student
    how to correct them. DO NOT PICK UP THE PEN AND CORRECT EVERYTHING
    YOURSELF.

  - Final step: ask student what the rules are for formatting, use of
    documentation, and references page. Lead the student to tell you
    what he or she knows and direct them to the resources that are
    available to them, such as their coursepack or Purdue’s OWL.

  - When the student receives the assignment back with the instructor’s
    feedback, ask the student to read the feedback out loud and explain
    what they think it means. Together, come up with goals for the next
    assignment.

# Academic Dishonesty and the Role of the Learning Coach

As the person on the front line with the student, the Learning Coach
will be the first person to see a student’s written work. Thus, the
Learning Coach has a role to pre-screen for suspected plagiarism and
ghost writing.

**If the essay seems suspicious, the Learning Coach should:**

  - Let the student know why. Show some examples of sentences that are
    too sophisticated and compare them to the student’s own sentences.
    Ask the student to restate the sentence out loud in his or her own
    style to check for comprehension. Write down what the student says
    and encourage her or him to rewrite the essay in this way.

  - Make a copy of the essay. Sign it and date it. Ask the student to
    sign it as well. Keep this on file in case the professor requests
    it.

  - Send an alert to the professor.

# Record-keeping and Reporting

At the end of each session, record briefly what you worked on with the
student and anything you noted about the student’s engagement or mood.
If you worked on a specific assignment, note what it was and which class
it was for. Once each week, take time to upload all your records to our
shared documents.

# Communicating with professors

It is expected that you will communicate with faculty to request
clarifications or further information. When doing so, cc the other
learning coaches in your program. You may also communicate with faculty
if you are hearing the same question or confusion from several students.
Your message should be offered as a suggestion not a complaint.

# Communicating with the supervisor

The learning coach sends a weekly report by email to the program
supervisor/director. This report should include the names of all
students who did not show up for an appointment as well as significant
concerns for individual students and other prayer requests. It is also
very helpful to highlight students who are doing particularly well or
have experienced something to celebrate.

If at any time, the learning coach seeks advice about how to work with a
specific student or how to use certain strategies, he or she can discuss
with Melinda Dewsbury.

# At-risk students

If the learning coach believes that a student is at-risk academically or
socially, he or she should identify this need to the program supervisor
for further action.

If a student’s need level or behavior is beyond the expertise of the
learning coach, she or he should consult the program supervisor as well.

If a student indicates significant depression or suicidal thoughts,
contact Melinda Dewsbury, Kelvin Gartly (Student Life), or Patti White
(Student Life) immediately to start a Student Intervention Protocol
(SIP).

If a student behaves in a way that is threatening, unsafe, or criminal,
call campus security at 2099 or call 911.

# Privacy

We must respect privacy laws. Do not have student files or work open on
your desk or computer. Do not show a student another student’s work
without permission. If a student shares something in confidence, keep
this trust. If you feel that it is something requiring intervention, ask
the student if you can do so. Do not share any information about a
student with a parent unless we have a signed Release of Information
form from the student.
