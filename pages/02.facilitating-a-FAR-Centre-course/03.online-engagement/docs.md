Here is where we'll mention the layout and features of most FAR Centre courses (e.g. units, learning activities, assessments, etc.)

The online courses will be accessible through Moodle, TWU’s online course database. They will be designed similarly to traditional online courses, but the design also considers the role of the face-to-face facilitator. Each course will be divided into units and lessons, and there will be a corresponding facilitator’s guide for each course that will outline how the facilitator can plan the learning labs in accordance with the material. Working overseas, the facilitator will be responsible for keeping in close contact with the instructor via email or ZOOM(similar to skype). It will be important for facilitators to read through the guide early enough to leave time to any necessary questions to the instructor.

It is also important that the facilitator takes time in the learning labs to teach the students how to use Moodle or any other online resources. Depending on where you are going, students may be unfamiliar with these technological platforms, and need help troubleshooting how to navigate the course page. Just because North American students may be familiar with working in online formats, it is best to take the time to explain the process.
