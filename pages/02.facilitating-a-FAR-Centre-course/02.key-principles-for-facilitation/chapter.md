### Facilitating a FAR Centre Course

# Key Principles for Facilitation
Below are some key reminders for you as you plan and deliver lessons in the FAR Centres. Refer also to your resources and course material from LDRS 627, 662, 663, 664, and 667.


## Androgogy
As you plan your learning activities, keep in mind these six assumptions about andragogy from Knowles (1980 cited in Merriam & Bierma, 2014, p.47)

1.  As a person matures, his or her self-concept moves from that of a
    dependent personality toward one of a **self-directing** human being.

2.  An adult accumulates a growing reservoir of **experience**, which is a
    rich resource for learning.

3.  The readiness of an adult to learn is closely related to the
    developmental tasks of his or her social role.

4.  There is a change in time perspective as people mature – from future
    application of knowledge to immediacy of **application**. Thus, an adult
    is more problem than subject centered in learning.

5.  Adults are mostly driven by **internal motivation**, rather than
    external motivators.

6.  Adults need to know the **reason** for learning something.

Here are a couple more beliefs about adult learning that place a primary emphasis on the role of critical thinking. (Brookfield, 2013, Knowles, 1970, Merriam & Caffarella, 1999, Schon, 1983,Vygotsky, 1978):

* Adults are self-directed and self-motivated. This does not mean that adults learn in isolation but that they are in charge of their own learning and held accountable.
* Adults have prior experiences that are rich resources for learning. The adult learner integrates new learning into what they already know.
* Adults appreciate the application of theory ‘in the real world’.
* Adults are responsible for their own learning and exhibit behaviors of an individual ready and wanting to learn.
* As an expert in the field, the instructor is a facilitator of learning – not a ‘sage on the stage’ but a ‘guide on the side’.
* Assignments are designed to challenge the learner, build upon concepts and encourage reflection on experience.
* Adults collaborate and support one another in their learning rather than compete. Everyone is capable of doing well.
* Self-reflection, dialogue, writing and collaborative small group work are essential in sense-making and learning. Rote memory and lecture are deemphasized.

### Prior Needs Assessment
Before you plan to teach anything, it’s a good idea to find out what
your students already know.  You can save time (and boredom) by not
spending time on topics or skills that they already know and instead
plan to enhance their knowledge and take them further.  This is a much
more motivating approach and one that adults will appreciate.  A prior
needs assessment is not always a "quiz" though – it can be a discussion,
a concept map, a KWL (Know, Want to Know, Learned), a ‘Minute Paper’…..
The idea is to plan a way to learn what the participants already know on
the topic. Because they are adults it’s important to recognize their
prior life experience.


### Learning with the Senses

Rather than planning a class based on the traditional lecture and PowerPoint, explore social-emotional learning and sensory-engaging pedagogies.  How can we incorporate the senses of sight, sound, smell, taste and touch into our teaching? 

Examples of sensory-engaged teaching methods:

* Auditory input such as recorded video lectures; incorporation of music

* Visuals - analysis of videos and film; incorporation of art

* Problem-solving through case studies

* Storytelling

* Place-based learning including learning in nature and other environments

* Kinesthetic or movement learning activities eg role play

* Activities that incorporate the olfactory (sense of smell) eg. bringing in spices from a region to evoke the culture of food

* Activities that incorporate the sense of touch - textured materials, manipulatives

* Discussion forums

* Use of interactive technology

### Active Learning 

Below are some active learning strategies you may want to incorporate into your lessons.

Choose one of the readings for a unit and ask students to:

a) read while walking

b) read aloud

c) read aloud while walking outside

d) draw a picture or graphic of the information

e) ask, "What is the effect of these sensory additions to your reading?"


### Experiential Learning

Corporate trainer, Dave Root defines experiential learning as "immersive activities that mimic real-world challenges with a targeted debrief that connects the lessons learned with the reality of the workplace. It allows participants to learn by doing."  Some examples of experiential learning include cooperative education, practicums, internships, studies abroad, field trips, service learning projects, role playing, case studies and simulations. For excellent examples and best practices in experiential learning, be sure to read this article from Ryerson University's Learning and Teaching Office.

>> Chapman et al. have provided a list of characteristics that should be present in order to define an activity or method as experiential. These characteristics include:
1. *Mixture of content and process:* There must be a balance between the experiential activities and the
underlying content or theory.
2. *Absence of excessive judgment:* The instructor must create a safe space for students to work through
their own process of self-discovery.
3. *Engagement in purposeful endeavors:* In experiential learning, the learner is the self-teacher,
therefore there must be “meaning for the student in the learning.” The learning activities must be
personally relevant to the student.
4. *Encouraging the big picture perspective:* Experiential activities must allow the students to make
connections between the learning they are doing and the world. Activities should build in students the
ability see relationships in complex systems and find a way to work within them.
5. *The role of reflection:* Students should be able to reflect on their own learning, bringing “the theory to
life” and gaining insight into themselves and their interactions with the world.
6. *Creating emotional investment:* Students must be fully immersed in the experience, not merely doing
what they feel is required of them. The “process needs to engage the learner to a point where what is
being learned and experience strikes a critical, central chord within the learner.”
7. *The re-examination of values:* By working within a space that has been made safe for selfexploration, students can begin to analyze and even alter their own values.
8. *The presence of meaningful relationships:* One part of getting students to see their learning in the
context of the whole world is to start by showing the relationships between “learner to self, learner to
teacher, and learner to learning environment.”
9. *Learning outside one’s perceived comfort zones:* “Learning is enhanced when students are given the
opportunity to operate outside of their own perceived comfort zones.” This doesn’t refer just to
physical environment, but also to the social environment. This could include, for instance, “being
accountable for one’s actions and owning the consequences” (Chapman, McPhee, & Proudman, 1995,
p. 243).
