Icebreakers are usually short activities that precede the main activity in a
classroom or any meeting, with the sole aim of warming up the meeting.
Icebreakers need to be properly planned and implemented otherwise they may break
or mar an event. Icebreakers should be

-   easy to do

-   not be boring

-   should not be long

-   should be engaging

There are several examples of activities that may be used as icebreakers.
