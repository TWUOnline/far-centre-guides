### Chapter Number

# Active Learning in the Classroom

Here is where we'll list a number of ways to engage students in the course.  Classroom activities include: discussions, partner/group assignments, role plays, vocabulary practice, study skills, online course help, videos, etc.


### Promoting Critical Thinking
Here are some examples of how to use the elements of critical thinking when designing activities:

  - Ask good questions – take your specific objectives for the lesson and create questions using the elements as prompts.

  - Group discussion – give students the elements and ask them to use them to analyze a reading or video.

  - Teach how to come up with a thesis statement using the elements. Take the topic and go around the circle asking each participant to create a statement from one of the prompts associated with the elements. At the end, you will end up with as many statements as there are participants. Help students work with the statements, combining them etc. to make their thesis statement. This process facilitates sharp thinking and helps to focus students.

  - Use the elements as an outline to help students writing in a more disciplined way about a topic.
