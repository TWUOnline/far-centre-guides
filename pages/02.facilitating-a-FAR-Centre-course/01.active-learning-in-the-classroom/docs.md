# Active Learning in the Classroom

To facilitate, in its most common definition, is to “make an action or process easy or easier”(Oxford definition). Therefore, a facilitator of learning is essentially someone who takes all measures to ensure that learning is possible and successful within its given context. Facilitators will consider contextual factors, student learning styles and educational targets to create a safe, productive space for student learning to be nurtured. 

In most face-to-face learning environments, the instructor will assume most facilitation duties, but other roles such as teaching assistants, learning coaches and educational administrators facilitate learning as well. In that sense, traditional learning environments don’t have one designated learning facilitator, but have many different people working together to aid the educational process.

In an international online learning community, facilitating learning looks different. The instructor can do their best to facilitate learning through online platforms, but because there are added barriers to learning in terms of proximity and culture differences, it can be challenging for instructors to provide their students with the support they need. This calls reframing how facilitation will work in this environment. A learning facilitator in a blended learning setting serves to fill the gaps in in international online high education by providing face-to-face support and learning facilitation, and they supplement the instructors’ facilitation duties by providing coaching, facilitation and IT support for the students who are taking the courses at their campus.
