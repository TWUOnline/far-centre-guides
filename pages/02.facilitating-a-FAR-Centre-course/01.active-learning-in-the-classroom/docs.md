# Active Learning in the Classroom

The heart and soul of teaching well is designing, sequencing and planning active learning opportunities around engaging and compelling content. This is creative work that requires the educator to research solid content aligned with the learning objectives and discern effective means of sharing and engaging learners with that content. Furthermore, it requires the educator to think about their specific learners, their prior knowledge about the topic, any fears or resistance they may bring to the topic and then carefully craft the time allotted so that objectives can be met in a fair, reasonably-paced, anxiety-free and hopefully enjoyable manner. It is tempting to try to use many fun activities during a session, but it’s very important to be judicious in selecting activities that serve a learning purpose. Avoid the trap of many beginning educators who focus more on ‘activitizing’ rather than aligning learning opportunities to objectives and assessment.

In the following sections, we'll list a number of ways to engage students in the course.  

Classroom activities include: discussions, partner/group assignments, role plays, vocabulary practice, study skills, online course help, videos, etc.

### Class Discussions
Facilitating discussion is a key skill of the adult educator and giving voice to the adult learner is one of the most important aspects for an adult educator to consider. Getting learners involved in the topic and having the confidence to speak in class and share their ideas whether through discussions or presentations, are essential elements of adult education.

### Promoting Critical Thinking
Here are some examples of how to use the elements of critical thinking when designing activities:

  - Ask good questions – take your specific objectives for the lesson and create questions using the elements as prompts.

  - Group discussion – give students the elements and ask them to use them to analyze a reading or video.

  - Teach how to come up with a thesis statement using the elements. Take the topic and go around the circle asking each participant to create a statement from one of the prompts associated with the elements. At the end, you will end up with as many statements as there are participants. Help students work with the statements, combining them etc. to make their thesis statement. This process facilitates sharp thinking and helps to focus students.

  - Use the elements as an outline to help students writing in a more disciplined way about a topic.
