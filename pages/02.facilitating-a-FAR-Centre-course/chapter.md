### Facilitating a FAR Centre Course

# Overview

Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime!  If you have accepted the position of a FAR Centre Facilitator, you are in for quite an experience!  As explained in the [FAR Centre Overview](https://far.twu.ca/guides/about-twu/far-centres), facilitators will be responsible for guiding students through Trinity courses, both to help them navigate the online components, but also to engage students in active learning experiences in the classroom.  In this section of the guide, we will explore various techniques that will help you in this role.
Note that other sections of the guide will go into specfics about your courses (e.g. India/ PHIL 210 / Instructor's Notes), so be sure to review those notes in detail.  For now, we will discuss key ideas you may remember from your courses in completing the Graduate Certificate In Adult Learning: Coaching And Facilitation.
