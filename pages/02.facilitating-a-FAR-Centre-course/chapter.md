### Facilitating a FAR Centre Course

## Overview

Welcome to the adventure of a lifetime!  If you have accepted the position of a FAR Centre Facilitator, you are in for quite an experience!  As explained in the [FAR Centre Overview](https://far.twu.ca/guides/about-twu/far-centres), facilitators will be responsible for guiding students through Trinity courses, both to help them navigate the online components, but also to engage students in active learning experiences in the classroom.  In this section of the guide, we will explore various techniques that will help you in this role.
Note that other sections of the guide will go into specfics about your courses (e.g. India/ PHIL 210 / Instructor's Notes), so be sure to review those notes in detail.  For now, we will discuss key ideas you may remember from your courses in completing the Graduate Certificate In Adult Learning: Coaching And Facilitation.

This facilitation guide is meant to help the facilitator navigate the complex and exciting territory of their own role. It will help answer the following questions:


- <p style='text-align: justify;'>What is a facilitator of learning, and what does the job entail?</p>

- How do you facilitate learning successfully?

- How does the facilitator help students engage in online learning?

- What will the facilitator's schedule look like?

- What is the coaching component of facilitation?

- Do facilitators do any assessment?

- How should the facilitator plan their learning labs?

- What are effective learning activities to include in learning labs?


These are just some of the questions that will be addressed in this manual, and because it is working document, the experiences of FAR Center facilitators will continue to inform the material.
