When you first heard of the title, ‘Global Academic Facilitator’, you may have been curious as to what the position entails. To ‘facilitate’ something refers to making an action or process easier (Oxford definition), and a facilitator of learning is someone who does whatever is necessary to ensure that learning can happen in a given environment. This could be through administering learning materials, coaching students individually, teaching content in a group setting, providing tech support, or whatever is needed for students to have a comprehensive learning experience.

Vaughan refers to facilitation as “the central activity of teaching in an educational community of inquiry that emerges from the activity between students and instructor”(p.46). Thus, in most face-to-face learning environments, the primary learning facilitator, seeing facilitative duties as a central part of their role. Nevertheless, facilitating a quality, transformational learning experience is a big role, and teaching assistants, learning coaches and educational administrators are there to perform supplemental facilitation duties roles so the teacher doesn’t have to. In that sense, facilitation of learning is a multifaceted endeavour, and it often takes a joint effort from several educational professionals to serve a learning community.

In an international online learning community, facilitating becomes even more complex. The instructor does their best to facilitate learning through online platforms, but because there are added barriers to learning, such as proximity and culture differences, it can be challenging for instructors to provide their students with the support they need.  Studies have shown that many students who attempt to take online courses from overseas institutions are not successful, as they do not understand the nuances of Western education or online learning technologies, nor do they have anyone there to help them make sense of the new structures. While it would be more cost-effective to be able to complete international online courses in their home country, it comes with significant challenges.

At TWU Global, we believe that while there are barriers to creating successful international online learning communities, it is not impossible with some restructuring of how facilitation will work in this environment. In addition to the online instructor, GLOBAL has designed a blended online learning program that relies on their academic facilitator to fill in these gaps in international online higher education. The role of the academic facilitator is to supplement the instructors’ facilitation duties by providing face-to-face coaching, administration, learning facilitation, and IT support for the students who are taking the courses at their campus. They do not instruct the course, but they provide direction for how students approach their courses and bridge any gaps in learning.


As a facilitator at a FAR Center, some of your primary duties will :

•	Plan and lead weekly Learning Labs that correspond with the units in the students courses

•	Provide both group and individual coaching in developing critical thinking skills, understanding major concepts and academic writing

•	Oversee the students completion of their courses

•	Facilitate quizzes and exams

•	Help students with technological difficulties

As you embark on your journey as a facilitator, your understanding of your own role will expand and shape according to where you are. Facilitators have a multilayered yet essential role that is informed by context, students and learning outcomes, and it requires flexibility, discernment and a readiness to learn.
