## Opening Exercises

Opening exercises (also referred to as warm-ups or icebreakers) should be tied to the data collected from pre-assessments and to the objectives of the session. It’s important to find ways to connect the learners’ experience to what you are going to be teaching. This will answer the unspoken question in participants’ minds: *Is this going to be worth my time?* Opening exercises should also help people feel connected in some way and establish some group sense of purpose.

Refer to Silberman chapter 3 for many practical strategies for team building, on the spot assessment and immediate learning involvement. Methods include: Open discussion, response cards, polling, subgroup discussions, partners, go-arounds, games, calling on the next speaker, panels and fishbowls.

##### **Syllabus Scavenger Hunt**
Consider having this activity for the first day of class.  See full details [here](http://thoughtsonteaching-jdunlap.blogspot.com/2008/10/scavenger-hunts-as-strategy-for.html)

##### **Name Bingo**
Text from Silberman ch. 3

1. Participants wander around the room and meet each other.

2. Each time a participant exchanges names with someone, she or he writes the new names anywhere on a Bingo form

3. After all participants have met, each one places and O in any unused box

4. The trainer then places a copy of everyone's name in a hat.

5. The hat is passed around the group, one participant at a time. Each participant picks a name out of a hat. Everyone places an X on the box containing the name picked.

6. Whenever any player obtains 5 Xs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), he or she yells "Bingo!" (Eventually, everyone will get Bingo several times.)

7. As their names are picked, participants should introduce themselves to the group and share three facts about themselves.

##### **Instructions for Tell the Truth**

1. Ask each participant to write down on a card three personal facts not previously shared with the group.

2. Mix up the cards and distribute a card to each participant. (Be sure no one receives his or her own card.)

3. Have each participant read the card she or he has been dealt, then ask for three guesses as to whose card was read. Prior to the guesses, request that participants not reveal their identity even if it is guessed.

4. Ask, " will the real bearer of this card please stand up?"

5. Allow for surprise or self-congratulatory applause.

# Tips for creating presentations

##### **Gaining your audiences interest**

1. Begin with a fun introductory exercise

2. Use a leadoff story or interesting visual that ties to the topic

3. Start off with an initial case problem

4. Test their present knowledge with quiz questions

5. Give them a preview of the presentation content

##### **Maximizing understanding and retention**

1. Opening summary of major points

2. Use headlines in your presentations

3. Provide real-life examples and illustrations

4. Create analogies for the concepts your are teaching

5. Visual back-up in your slides

##### **Involving Participants during presentation**

1. Assign students with assigned listening troubleshooting

2. Create guided-notetaking in your slides

3. On-the-spot challenge

4. Involve synergetic learning through giving different information to different participants

5. Use illuminating exercises throughout the presentation

##### **Reinforcing presentations**

1. Facilitate a mini-press conference where students present their questions and comments regarding session.

2. Participant Review- Students review the contents of the presentation with each other

3. Group processing and reflection on the material learned

4. Post-presentation case problem based on the material learned
