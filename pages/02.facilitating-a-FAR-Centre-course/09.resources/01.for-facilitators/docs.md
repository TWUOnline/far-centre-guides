## Opening Exercises

Opening exercises (also referred to as warm-ups or icebreakers) should be tied to the data collected from pre-assessments and to the objectives of the session. It’s important to find ways to connect the learners’ experience to what you are going to be teaching. This will answer the unspoken question in participants’ minds: *Is this going to be worth my time?* Opening exercises should also help people feel connected in some way and establish some group sense of purpose.

Refer to Silberman chapter 3 for many practical strategies for team building, on the spot assessment and immediate learning involvement. Methods include: Open discussion, response cards, polling, subgroup discussions, partners, go-arounds, games, calling on the next speaker, panels and fishbowls.

##### **Syllabus Scavenger Hunt**
Consider having this activity for the first day of class.  See full details [here](http://thoughtsonteaching-jdunlap.blogspot.com/2008/10/scavenger-hunts-as-strategy-for.html)

##### **Name Bingo**
Text from Silberman ch. 3

1. Participants wander around the room and meet each other.

2. Each time a participant exchanges names with someone, she or he writes the new names anywhere on a Bingo form

3. After all participants have met, each one places and O in any unused box

4. The trainer then places a copy of everyone's name in a hat.

5. The hat is passed around the group, one participant at a time. Each participant picks a name out of a hat. Everyone places an X on the box containing the name picked.

6. Whenever any player obtains 5 Xs in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), he or she yells "Bingo!" (Eventually, everyone will get Bingo several times.)

7. As their names are picked, participants should introduce themselves to the group and share three facts about themselves.

##### **Instructions for Tell the Truth**

1. Ask each participant to write down on a card three personal facts not previously shared with the group.

2. Mix up the cards and distribute a card to each participant. (Be sure no one receives his or her own card.)

3. Have each participant read the card she or he has been dealt, then ask for three guesses as to whose card was read. Prior to the guesses, request that participants not reveal their identity even if it is guessed.

4. Ask, " will the real bearer of this card please stand up?"

5. Allow for surprise or self-congratulatory applause.

# Tips for creating presentations

##### **Gaining your audiences interest**

1. Begin with a fun introductory exercise

2. Use a leadoff story or interesting visual that ties to the topic

3. Start off with an initial case problem

4. Test their present knowledge with quiz questions

5. Give them a preview of the presentation content

##### **Maximizing understanding and retention**

1. Opening summary of major points

2. Use headlines in your presentations

3. Provide real-life examples and illustrations

4. Create analogies for the concepts your are teaching

5. Visual back-up in your slides

##### **Involving Participants during presentation**

Involving participants during presentations is a way to foster student engagement, and it is another useful method in ensuring students understand and retain the information they are learning. Here are some practical ways you can involve students during presentations.

1. Assign students with assigned listening troubleshooting

2. Create guided note-taking in your slides

3. On-the-spot challenge

4. Involve synergetic learning through giving different information to different participants

5. Use illuminating exercises throughout the presentation

##### **Reinforcing presentations**

Here is a summary of recommendations from the Silberman text about how to reinforce presentations after you have finished presenting to your students. Reinforcing presentations is crucial to helping students retain what they have learned.

1. Facilitate a mini-press conference where students present their questions and comments regarding session.

2. Participant Review- Students review the contents of the presentation with each other.

3. Group processing and reflection on the material learned.

4. Post-presentation case problem based on the material learned.

5. Create an experiential activity that dramatically illustrates or summarizes the main points in the presentation.

##### **Alternative Teaching Techniques**   

While presentations may seem like the easiest way to communicate material to learners, using a variety of teaching techniques can keep learning labs interesting and cater to students unique learning styles. Here are some ideas for other ways you can teach students.

1. **Demonstrate** your material either through group experiments of simulation exercises.

2. Hand out **case studies** of relevant situations in which students are required to make reflections, assessments and recommendations in regard to the case.

3. Create **guided teaching** exercises through asking students questions, recording their hypotheses or conclusions and then comparing them with the answers you have in your presentation points.

4. Lead a **group inquiry** with the students that has them asking questions about the topic, and the teacher can guide the group through a problem-solving quest based on the student's questions.

5. Create **information searching** assignments for the students to complete. This could look like a sheet of questions, fill in the blanks, or true or false, and then provide them resources where they can look for the answers.

6. Have students form several **study groups**, and give a worksheet with notes from the presentation to all the groups for them to discuss with one another.

7. Divide the students into groups and facilitate a **jigsaw learning** activity. Divide the presentation material into different sections, and give each group of students a section that they must learn and then teach to the rest of the class.
