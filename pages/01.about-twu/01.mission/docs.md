### Mission
TWU is like no other university in Canada in its approach and commitment: it exists so that the world may experience Christ’s truth, compassion, reconciliation, and hope; it is a university that is informed by the rich Christian understandings and traditions that frame the study of the various academic disciplines; and, it is a university that is committed to continually building on its educational vitality.

The TWU FAR Centres exist to guide students through online and face-to-face classes, to foster a sense of belonging as students engage in the culture and community of TWU, to instill Godly Christian leadership principles and practices into every facet of students’ lives, and prepare students for a lifetime of impact and significance in the world long after the completion of their degree.

A significant aspect of this mission involves helping students discover who God has created them to be, what He has called them to do, and how TWU can help them prepare for those unique callings. It is in these ways that TWU is different than at any other university.

### Core Values
* Hospitality that conveys a genuine welcome to all that come to TWU,
* Responsiveness to the changing and individual needs of TWU students during times of transition,
* Supportive Service of our students and student leaders, modeled on the love, grace and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, and
* Empowerment of Students as they take ownership of their university journey.
