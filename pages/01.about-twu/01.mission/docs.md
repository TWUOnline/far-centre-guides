### Mission
TWU is like no other university in Canada in its approach and commitment: it exists so that the world may experience Christ’s truth, compassion, reconciliation, and hope; it is a university that is informed by the rich Christian understandings and traditions that frame the study of the various academic disciplines; and, it is a university that is committed to continually building on its educational vitality.

The TWU FAR Centres exist to guide students through online and face-to-face classes, to foster a sense of belonging as students engage in the culture and community of TWU, to instill Godly Christian leadership principles and practices into every facet of students’ lives, and to prepare students for a lifetime of impact and significance in the world long after the completion of their degree.

A significant aspect of this mission involves helping students discover who God has created them to be, what He has called them to do, and how TWU can help them prepare for those unique callings. It is in these ways that TWU is different than at any other university.

### Core Values
TRINITY WESTERN UNIVERSITY IS COMMITTED TO SEVEN CORE VALUES:

* Obeying the Authority of Scripture: Both individually and corporately Trinity Western wholeheartedly embraces all the Bible teaches in regard to faith, ethical commitments, and way of life, believing it to be the ultimate standard of truth and hope.

* Pursuing Faith-Based and Faith-Affirming Learning: Trinity Western's starting point for learning is that God calls humans to be stewards of His creation, doers of good toward all people, and agents of His reconciliation.

* Having a Transformational Impact on Culture: God calls His followers to influence both individuals and the culture in which they live and ultimately draw people to Him. Trinity Western's programs encourage thought, word and deed that affect the dynamics and institutions of our society on the basis of biblical principles such as justice, mercy and hope.

* Servant Leadership as a Way of Life: Trinity Western strives to teach and to embody the pattern of servant leadership exemplified by Jesus Christ. Professors, administrators and students seek to motivate and mobilize each other to think and act with creativity, integrity, and skill for the benefit of all concerned.

* Striving for Excellence in University Education: Trinity Western promotes not only academic and intellectual excellence, but integrates these with high standards of personal, moral, and spiritual integrity.

* Discipling in Community: At Trinity Western, students, staff, faculty and administrators are all invited and encouraged to deepen their understanding of what it means to be disciples of Jesus Christ, to practice such discipleship, and to sustain and help others to be and become disciples. They strive to act justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.

* Practising Christian Hospitality: Welcomes, genuinely includes and consistently cares for all individuals. Christ taught and modeled hospitality to all, including those on the margins, as an essential element of Christian faith and practice. Hospitality is vital to our life in the Trinity Western University community and to our life in, and witness to, other communities.
