Trinity Western is a Christian, liberal arts University. As a
***Christian*** university, Trinity Western is grounded in the
historical Christian tradition and seeks to unite reason and faith
through teaching and scholarship. As a ***liberal arts*** university,
Trinity Western prepares students to deal with complexity, diversity,
and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world
and helping them to develop transferable intellectual and practical
skills.

The Student Learning Outcomes pertain to the whole University but it is
recognized that they apply most directly to the undergraduate
experience. The University’s graduate programs are diverse and highly
specialized and thus support the University student learning outcomes
through curricula which are appropriate to those specializations and the
nature of the degrees offered.
