Trinity Western is a Christian, liberal arts University. As a
***Christian*** university, Trinity Western is grounded in the
historical Christian tradition and seeks to unite reason and faith
through teaching and scholarship. As a ***liberal arts*** university,
Trinity Western prepares students to deal with complexity, diversity,
and change by providing them with a broad knowledge of the wider world
and helping them to develop transferable intellectual and practical
skills.

The Student Learning Outcomes pertain to the whole University but it is
recognized that they apply most directly to the undergraduate
experience. The University’s graduate programs are diverse and highly
specialized and thus support the University student learning outcomes
through curricula which are appropriate to those specializations and the
nature of the degrees offered.

It is intended that through the range of their experiences at Trinity
Western University, students should prepare for a life of learning and
service by developing:

**KNOWLEDGE AND ITS APPLICATION**

  - a broad foundational knowledge of human culture and the physical and
    natural world.

  - a depth of understanding in any chosen field(s) of study. applied
    knowledge acquired through discipline-appropriate experiential
    learning.

**COGNITIVE COMPLEXITY**

  - skills including: critical and creative thinking, quantitative and
    qualitative reasoning, communication, research, and information
    literacy.

  - an ability to articulate various interdisciplinary and
    multi-disciplinary perspectives, integrating informed Christian
    perspectives.

  - an ability to respond with wisdom, humility and charity to
    questions, issues, and problems of the human condition.

**AESTHETIC EXPRESSION AND INTERPRETATION**

  - creative, performative, material and narrative forms of critical
    inquiry.

  - intuitive, imaginative and interpretive methodologies. ways of
    knowing through which maker and receiver come to insight and
    understanding. collaborative and community–based interdisciplinary
    practices.

**INTER-AND INTRA-PERSONAL WELLNESS**

  - a holistic awareness of their personhood, purpose, and calling
    within the context of the communities in which they live and study.
    personal and social health. an appreciation of the role of community
    in wellness.

**SPIRITUAL FORMATION**

  - a spiritual dimension by means of an exposure to a reflective and
    caring Christ-centred community which encourages:

      - *a further understanding of God.* o *a discovery of a deep and
        personal spiritual foundation.*

      - *an embodiment of a Christ-like way of life characterized by
        love for and service to others.*

**SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY AND GLOBAL ENGAGEMENT**

    citizens who serve locally, nationally, and globally in socially and

## TWU Grading Scale

|Grade|Expectations|
|:---:|---|
|A|**Outstanding, excellent work**; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.)|
| B|**Good, competent work**; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.|
|C|**Adequate, reasonably satisfactory work**; fair performance but infrequent evidence of original thinking or the capacity to analyze, synthesize, or evaluate course material; undue reliance on rote memory; difficulty in applying knowledge in unfamiliar contexts; limited problem-solving ability in scientific subjects; fairly clear but quite uninspiring written expression with occasional problems in mechanics or syntax; weak in provision of documented, illustrative, or descriptive evidence; satisfactory grasp of basic elements of the course but frequent lapses in detailed understanding. Satisfies the minimum requirements of the course.|
| D|**Minimally acceptable work**; relatively weak performance with little evidence of original thinking or ability to analyze or synthesize course material; nominal or weak problem-solving ability in scientific subjects; written expression frequently exhibits difficulty in articulating a central thesis or sustaining a coherent argument; ideas are trite or juvenile, without discernible development. Shows inadequate grasp of some basic elements of the course.|
| F|**Inadequate work**; poor performance that indicates a lack of understanding or misunderstanding of essential subject matter; seems easily distracted by the irrelevant; written expression is poorly organized, often incoherent, and rife with mechanical and diction errors. Shows little evidence of even basic competency in the course content or skills.|
