In GitHub parlance, you contribute to someone else's repo by forking it, editing your fork, then submitting a 'pull request' to the original owner of the repo. For this course, we will use the repo at https://github.com/TWUOnline/far-centre-guides.

To begin, go to the [FAR Centre Guides repo](https://github.com/TWUOnline/far-centre-guides) and fork it to your own account. This will create an identical copy of the repo in your account, and you will be able to edit the copy without changing the original files.

Once you have forked the 'Getting Started with GitHub' repo, please add your contact information and a brief bio to the README.md file. If you would like, you can simply link to an intro post on your blog.

When you are editing text in GitHub, you will notice that there is no WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, but don't worry, it is very easy to style your text in GitHub using what is known as MarkDown.
