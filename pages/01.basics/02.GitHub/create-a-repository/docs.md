### Create a Repository
GitHub is organized into projects called ***repositories***. Each repository (repo) is a set of related text documents, sometimes organized into folders, but not necessarily.

If you were composing in MS Word, or another word processor, a repository would be analogous to a document or file. Each file inside the repository would be analogous to major sections or chapters in your document.

###### In the top, right corner of your GitHub homepage, click the **+** and choose ***New repository***.

###### 1. Give your new repository a name (letters, numbers, and dashes only).
###### 2. Provide a short description (optional).
###### 3. With a free GitHub account, you will only be able to create public repositories.
###### 4. Select ***Initialize this repository with a README.***
###### 5. Click ***Create repository***

###### 3. Edit the page using [Markdown](https://far.twu.ca/guides/basics/markdown).
###### 4. Click ***Preview changes*** to see what you have changed.
Red indicates content that has been deleted; green indicates new content.
###### 5. Provide a brief description of the changes you made to the file.
###### 6. Decide whether you will commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If you are currently editing the `master` branch, you should create a new branch and create a pull request by clicking ***Propose file change***.
