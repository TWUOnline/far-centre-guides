### Create a Repository
GitHub is organized into projects called ***repositories***. Each repository (repo) is a set of related text documents, sometimes organized into folders, but not necessarily.

If you were composing in MS Word, or another word processor, a repository would be analogous to a document or file. Each file inside the repository would be analogous to major sections or chapters in your document.

###### In the top, right corner of your GitHub homepage, click the **+** and choose ***New repository***.

###### 1. Give your new repository a name (letters, numbers, and dashes only).
###### 2. Provide a short description (optional).
###### 3. With a free GitHub account, you will only be able to create public repositories.
###### 4. Select ***Initialize this repository with a README.***
###### 5. Click ***Create repository***

###### 1. Click on the link ***README.md***.

###### 3. Edit the page using [Markdown](https://far.twu.ca/guides/basics/markdown).
###### 4. Click ***Preview changes*** to see what you have changed.
Red indicates content that has been deleted; green indicates new content.
###### 5. Provide a brief description of the changes you made to the file.
###### 6. Decide whether you will commit to the current branch or to a new branch. If you are currently editing the `master` branch, you should create a new branch and create a pull request by clicking ***Propose file change***.

### Fork a Repo

In GitHub parlance, you contribute to someone else's repo by forking it, editing your fork, then submitting a 'pull request' to the original owner of the repo. For this course, we will use the repo at https://github.com/TWUOnline/far-centre-guides.

To begin, go to the [FAR Centre Guides repo](https://github.com/TWUOnline/far-centre-guides) and fork it to your own account. This will create an identical copy of the repo in your account, and you will be able to edit the copy without changing the original files.

Once you have forked the 'Getting Started with GitHub' repo, please add your contact information and a brief bio to the README.md file. If you would like, you can simply link to an intro post on your blog.

When you are editing text in GitHub, you will notice that there is no WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor, but don't worry, it is very easy to style your text in GitHub using what is known as MarkDown.
