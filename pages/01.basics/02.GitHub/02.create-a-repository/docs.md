GitHub is organized into projects called ***repositories***. Each repository (repo) is a set of related text documents, sometimes organized into folders, but not necessarily.

If you were composing in MS Word, or another word processor, a repository would be analogous to a document or file. Each file inside the repository would be analogous to major sections or chapters in your document.

###### In the top, right corner of your GitHub homepage, tap the **+** and choose ***New repository***.
