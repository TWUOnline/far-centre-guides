## Unit 10:

This is the 9th topic of 10. Your actions are:

-   Note there are 2 separate files that are “Facilitators Guides”

    -   Open these and use these.

    -   They should be self-explanatory, but if not contact the instructor for
        more details

-   Play the web videos.

[details= "Facilitator’s Guide: Scenarios for PO Types"]

Multiple choice section:

1)  Cost Plus Incentive Fee. There is a cost, plus a fixed amount.

2)  Firm Fixed Price. One price is mentioned an nothing else.

3)  Time and Materials. Time added for ‘employee time’, many T\&M
    contracts have a ‘not to exceed’ clause.

4)  Cost Plus Incentive Fee. Incentives are listed – very specific and
    measurable.

5)  Cost Plus Award Fee. Award is granted for ‘exceptional service’.
    Similar to \#4, but language suggests the ‘award’.

6)  Fixed Price Incentive Fee. Similar to \#2, but with an added
    incentive.

**‘If time permits’ section:**

**<span class="underline">Scenario One:</span>**

There are a few options, and many variables:

  - “The duration of this PO is contingent up on the satisfactory scores
    from a Customer Survey to be completed after 90 days and 365 days.
    The survey will be developed by our HR team and will be agreed upon
    by both parties prior to the execution of this PO.”

  - Another option would be to limit the contract to a year.

**<span class="underline">Scenario Two:</span>**

  - The best option is to try for a Net 90 Payment Terms from all of
    your sources. Prudent behavior would have been to ALREADY do this
    prior to agreeing to price with the customer.

  - Another option would be to have an agreement in place to pay Net 65.

**<span class="underline">Scenario Three:</span>**

  - This type of an agreement depends on the Taco Truck owner. If they
    are new to you, then there is likely a ‘minimum sales’ agreement
    (you guaranteeing a minimum amount of sales). Otherwise, if they
    know you, they just show up and you pay with a credit card (unless
    you can write a fast check).

**<span class="underline">Scenario Four:</span>**

  - This is easy. There needs to be a “not to exceed…” clause on the
    total price.

**<span class="underline">Scenario Five:</span>**

  - Have the PO written up, but have it for $1 (a contract MUST have
    ‘some’ financial exchange to be valid/enforceable).

**<span class="underline">  
</span>**

**<span class="underline">Scenario Six:</span>**

Everything depends on how much inventory you hold at the end.

If we assume that the Inventory Carrying Costs are 22%, then:

  - $50 x 12 = $600 x .22 = 132… + 600 = $732 for the non-discounted
    price

  - But if you ‘took the 2% discount’ ($50 x .98 = 49… 49 x 12 - 588)
    then, $588 x .22 = 129.36 + 588 = $717.36

  - 732/717.36 = 2%

The key to this answer is the 2.0%... is this the best your organization
could have done with the cash?

  - Usually, no. The common achievement for a thriving/functioning
    company is a MINIMUM of a 6% return… based on this, don’t take the
    terms if your cash can be better used elsewhere

**SPECIAL NOTE:** There may be other factors that come into play that
suggest you SHOULD take the discount. Namely, accountants can be rather
creative when they need to. REDUCING cash on purpose (to reduce tax
burden) can impact HUGE amounts of dollars. Plus, reducing liabilities
(paying your bills) also affects how financial documents are perceived.

[details= "Make or Buy Facilitator’s Guide"]

1.  Do the math for each:

    1.  8 months x $5000 per month + $2000 service charge = $42,000… too
        low, so rent it.

    2.  16 months x $5000 per month + $2000 service charge = $82,000…
        still too low, so rent it.

    3.  21 months x $5000 per month + $2000 service charge = $107,000…
        just over $105,000, so buy it.

    4.  Answer C is the closest, so it is the best option. But, the
        25-month option would still suggest to buy it.

2.  This is a simple Make or Buy decision, so you can work out the math.
    The contractor’s quote of $19,000 per week for a 16-week job means
    that buying will cost you $19,000 x 16 = $304,000. On the other
    hand, if you decided to keep the work in-house, then it will cost
    you $35,000 for the engineer, plus $15,000 per week for 16 weeks:
    $35,000 + (16 x $15,000) = $275,000. It will be cheaper to make it
    rather than buy it.

3.  This one considers the weekly price DIFFERENCE of ($19,000-15,000 =
    $4000. $35,000/4000 = 8.7

4.  $540 - $520 = $20. $1000/$20 = 50 weeks… the ‘pay back’. So, YES,
    the contract is worth it.

5.  Make It = $540 x 52 weeks = $28,080. Buy it = $520 x 52 weeks =
    $27,040… plus the $1000 fee = $28,040… the difference is a meager
    $40, but still worth Buying it.
