## General Comments:

Thank you for taking on the role of a FAR Centre Facilitator. You are the
‘conduit’ between the students and the instructor. Your input into the FAR
Centre activities will help shape the quality of the education that awaits the
students. This is a very noble role to be in.

It is recommended that you review the weekly FAR Centre activities prior to the
sessions. Do not hesitate to contact the instructor with any questions you have.

As a facilitator, you will be considering the weekly input that each student
offers. You will supply the instructor with a weekly recap of each student’s
participation… both in quality and quantity. Plus, you will consider and denote
their team participation.

Important: Sometimes the activities will include student opinions and
experiences. As long as they are fitting to the assignment, these really cannot
be graded. In all PMPP courses, we strongly encourage students to share their
experiences… it only has to be relevant to the course content. Again, you are
looking for quality and quantity of what the students share.

There will be numerous occasions when the assignment calls for content that
doesn’t exist. No worries. The students can (creatively) ‘make up’ their own.
They can make up names, titles, dollar estimates, and so on. You see, the goal
of the assignment work is not always in the details but in the overall format of
the finished assignment.
