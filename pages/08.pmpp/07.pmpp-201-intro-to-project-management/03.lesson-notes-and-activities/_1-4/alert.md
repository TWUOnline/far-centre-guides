#### FAR Centre Activity 1.4.0: Determining Styles

From the AIO list on Page 101, You are to select the ONE style you relate to the most. And, from the CL list in Chapter 7, you are to determine your Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary styles. It is NOT an exercise of picking the ones they aspire to, but to pick the styles that best describe you.

  - Facilitator Note: TWO handouts: Leadership Styles 1 & 2. This will be a list of the Styles and a ‘grid’ for students to take notes.

#### FAR Centre Activity 1.4.1: Discussion of Styles

Each student will then share their AIO style with the class, and give a brief statement as to why they chose that one. Then, they are to share their Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary styles from the CL list, and include examples as to why they selected those as best describing their leadership styles. Please understand that some leaders are not experts in more than one or two, but can present several styles. Whereas, others are experts in one and don’t spend much time in a Secondary or Tertiary style

  - Facilitator Note: It is common for people that know each other to provide feedback during the presentation portion of this exercise. DO NOT STOP THIS\! There can be major revelations come to light during this process. After each student shares, ask the group, “Do you disagree? Can you give a reason or example why? Repeat this for every student.
