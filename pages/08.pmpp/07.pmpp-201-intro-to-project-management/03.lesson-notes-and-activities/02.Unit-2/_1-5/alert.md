#### FAR Centre Activity 2.4.1: Build a Change Control Request Form.

(This exercise is best if you think about the whole change control needs of the entire organization represented in your scenario. (I.e. Can you establish a change control system that can handle ALL organizational changes, not just project work?))

Your team will determine the change control system needs and then create a Change Control Request Form. You can either create the new form, or you can modify what you find. For those that choose to modify an existing form, do a web search for a “Change Control Request Form” and select the best one that fits your scenario from 2.1.1, then modify it as necessary to fit your need.

There are likely MANY options that would fit all of your needs. Take your time comparing different forms.

Some topics to consider:
  - Being TOO specific could prove to have negative impact - Again, you would strive for a Change Control Request Form that could be used throughout the organization… and NOT just for project use
  - Proper description of the change request
  - Accommodates BOTH Corrective Action and Preventative Action (CAPA)
  - Allows for revision during the approval process
  - Provides space for stakeholder sign-offs
  - Clearly denotes financial and time impacts
  - Target a single page, if possible
  - In the bigger picture, each form would be entered into a Change Request Log\[2\]

#### FAR Centre Activity 2.4.2: Share your results with the group.

Each team will share their forms. They must justify the existence of each line of content. Students should offer input to each presentation for improvements. Forms should be clear and concise, but powerful.
