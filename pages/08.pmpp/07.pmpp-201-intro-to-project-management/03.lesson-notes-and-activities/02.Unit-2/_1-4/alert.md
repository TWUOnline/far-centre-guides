#### FAR Centre Activity 2.3.1: Create a (Monitoring and Controlling) Dashboard

Your team will use the same scenario from 2.1.1. The Facilitator will provide you with a file of sample charts to pick from. Your team will be selecting the best 8 charts to determine the health of your project. (You will assume the project is in progress, approximately 50% completed.)

On A3/11x17 paper, using the sample charts (to pick from), you must select the BEST 8 charts for your scenario, including providing a rationale for their selection.

But this is not JUST picking charts. Your team must justify the choices. Considering this is a hypothetical scenario, you must also assume you have a collection of stakeholders to ‘keep happy’. What do THEY want to know?

Don’t forget, a dashboard is NOT JUST for giving a ‘snapshot’ of the status (monitoring) … the charts are to help the stakeholders make educated decisions (controlling) about the project. Because of this, DO NOT pick the charts that share ONLY ‘happy news’.

#### FAR Centre Activity 2.3.2: Present your Dashboards

Your team will denote on WHY your charts were chosen. Your team will make their presentation, and the other students should offer probing input to ‘question’ your rationales.

Sometimes, there is not a ‘correct answer’ for every chart, as this is driven by the desires of the stakeholders within a given project. It is OK (and maybe fun) to discuss the stakeholder (communication) ‘requirements’ for your scenario. For example, some stakeholders don’t care much, and others ‘want to know everything’.
