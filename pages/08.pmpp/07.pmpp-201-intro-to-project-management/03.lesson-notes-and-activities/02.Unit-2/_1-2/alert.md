#### FAR Centre Activity 2.1.1: Write Charter and Scope Statements; Basic Budget; and WBS

Form teams of 3 to 5 and select from a list found in the file, [Charter Exercise Project Needs](U2-Charter-Exercise-Project-Needs.docx). During this exercise, you are welcome to use a web search to consider as samples as your team drafts a Charter Statement and Scope Statement. Included with these, your team will include a mention of the budget and WBS. For example, “We want to form a team to accomplish \_\_\_\_\_\_ (deliverable) for $\_\_\_\_\_\_ investment, to be completed by \_\_\_\_\_ (date).”

Budget details should include: “$\_\_\_\_\_ investment yields $\_\_\_\_\_ return.” Yes, you will have to ‘make up’ the numbers… it is the format that is the most important. (Try to have the numbers somewhat believable, though.)

WBS details should be 3 to 5 milestones, with dates… the last one being completion. Like the budget, you are fabricating (estimating) the schedule. Ending with a proper format is the most important part of this exercise.

#### FAR Centre Activity 2.1.2: Charter, Scope, Budget, and WBS Presentations

After 2.1.0 is completed, your team will share the results with the class. Students will have an opportunity to ask questions, offer comments, and help each team to refine their final version. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes per team.

Your team’s final version be shared with each student on your team. Then, you will upload this file into Moodle, along with your Weekly Recap Status Report.

  - Following the weekly FAR Centre session, you will submit a Weekly Recap Status Report to denote:
      - Your recap of topics discussed
      - Select from your list the most important and comment as to why it is important to you
  - Facilitator Note: Provide feedback to the instructor on each student’s helpfulness and level of participation.
