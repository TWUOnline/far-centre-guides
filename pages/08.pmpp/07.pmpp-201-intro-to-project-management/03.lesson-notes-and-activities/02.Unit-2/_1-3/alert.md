#### FAR Centre Activity 2.2.1: Return to your teams and calculate the FV’s and PV’s

Returning back to your groups, refer to the [FV/PV Worksheet](U2-FV-PV-Worksheet.xlsx). There are different scenarios listed. Your team is to calculate the FV or PV (depends on the scenario). Be sure to pay close attention to the details to ensure your team selects the correct formula.
You are welcome to review the video from Personal Activity 2.0.5.

#### FAR Centre Activity 2.2.2: Share your FV/PV results with the class

After your calculations are done, the group will reconvene to discuss the answers. It is important for you to be able to discern the correct formula to use, and to calculate it properly.

  - During this discussion time, of your team gets ‘stuck’, the Facilitator will be provided with the key, and an explanation of how the calculations were completed.
