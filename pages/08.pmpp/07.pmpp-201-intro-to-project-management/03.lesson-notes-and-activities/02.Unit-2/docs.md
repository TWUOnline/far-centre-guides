## Unit 2:

This week starts the 10 weeks of the primary topics of project management. Your
primary actions are:

-   On the ‘FV and PV Worksheet’, the answers can be found on Sheet 2, scrolling
    right to column AA.

    -   Work through these as a class, if necessary. The whole group needs to
        understand the formulae.

-   For the ‘Dashboard Instructions and Sample Charts’ file, it may be easier to
    print these and then have the students cut them out and paste them onto an
    11x17/A4 sheet of paper.

    -   The result is to look like a real-world organizational dashboard.
