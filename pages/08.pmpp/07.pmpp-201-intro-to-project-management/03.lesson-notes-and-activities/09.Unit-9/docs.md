## Unit 9:

This is the 8th topic of PM work. Your actions are:

-   This unit contains The Risk Register. This template is used in several PMPP
    courses and it a VERY powerful tool.

    -   As students work though this, they will learn that their Probability and
        Impact numbers have a HUGE effect on the total Risk Contingency.

        -   Encourage revision (lowering) if this happens.

    -   Allow student to enter creative content as necessary to complete this.
