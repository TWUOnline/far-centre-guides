#### FAR Centre Activity 1.3.0: Watch YouTube’s “The 4 Essentials of Innovation”

Watch this video and take notes to help develop a fuller understanding of all 4 Essentials. You will be discussing these 4 Essentials during the next two Activities.

#### FAR Centre Activity 1.3.1: The 4 Essentials of Innovation ‘In Order’

Considering the ‘4 Essentials of Innovation’, put these in order of importance (viewpoints can, and will vary). You are to explain your choices and will need to include examples.

#### FAR Centre Activity 1.3.2: The 4 Essentials Presentation

All students will share their findings with the class; not only the list, but why they have chosen this order. This should take about 3 minutes per student.

  - Facilitator Note: Students will be presenting their opinions, which is not gradable. Students will have a varying amount of personal creativity and this may ‘come out’ during their presentations. But either way, they need to provide a clear and concise justification for their choices.
