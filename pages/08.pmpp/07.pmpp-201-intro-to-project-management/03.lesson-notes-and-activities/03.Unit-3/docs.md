## Unit 3:

This is the second topic and should require some creativity to complete. Your
actions are:

-   You may need to guide students to find samples of WBS’s on the web.

-   Excel’s Insert/SmartArt/Hierarchy is a VERY valuable tool to accomplish this
    session with confidence.

    -   If necessary, play a web-video on how to do this.

-   Students should take advantage of the free software from
    [www.yworks.com](http://www.yworks.com), and download yEd.

    -   If necessary, play the 6-minute tutorial to help them.
