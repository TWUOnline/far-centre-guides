## Unit 11:

This is the 10th and final topic. Your actions are:

-   Note there is a separate file as the ‘Potential Stakeholders Facilitators
    Guide’

    -   Be familiar with this prior to the session.

-   Play the web video.

-   If you can, whether on paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard, draw the DiSC
    12-slice wheel and plot each student’s results. The keys are to:

    -   See the relationships/variance.

        -   A score of: I-33%, D-32%, C- 5%, S-5% would be marked with a spot
            about 2/3rd from the center right in the middle of the ID ‘slice’

    -   Your wheel’s outer ring is 50%. You can draw a middle ring, half way,
        for 25%, if that helps.

    -   Remind students that even though you are drawing a dot for each student,
        their results are NOT a single dot on the wheel, but a ‘wide range’ (AND
        that range usually covers up to half of the wheel).

        -   Therefore, only those that are at the extreme edges have difficulty
            communicating with those that are their opposites.
