## Unit 11:

This is the 10th and final topic. Your actions are:

-   Note there is a separate file as the ‘Potential Stakeholders Facilitators
    Guide’

    -   Be familiar with this prior to the session.

-   Play the web video.

-   If you can, whether on paper, chalkboard, or whiteboard, draw the DiSC
    12-slice wheel and plot each student’s results. The keys are to:

    -   See the relationships/variance.

        -   A score of: I-33%, D-32%, C- 5%, S-5% would be marked with a spot
            about 2/3rd from the center right in the middle of the ID ‘slice’

    -   Your wheel’s outer ring is 50%. You can draw a middle ring, half way,
        for 25%, if that helps.

    -   Remind students that even though you are drawing a dot for each student,
        their results are NOT a single dot on the wheel, but a ‘wide range’ (AND
        that range usually covers up to half of the wheel).

        -   Therefore, only those that are at the extreme edges have difficulty
            communicating with those that are their opposites.

            This scenario is based on a true story…

            There is some flexibility to these answers, but here are the
            Instructor’s selections:

            **<span class="underline">Direct:</span>**

              - Dave Johnson, Quality Engineer, WhinerCo

                  - Accesses meetings via video conference call

              - Billy Git, CEO, YourCo

                  - It is his neck that is on the line

              - William Sparkle, Quality Engineer, YourCo

                  - This is likely the \#1 play on the team

                  - Try to delegate as much FROM him, but only to trustworthy people

              - Shauna Lush, Chief Inspector, YourCo

                  - This one will require regular monitoring and controlling due to
                    her attendance issues. BE CAREFUL, don’t over extend AND have a
                    Plan B

              - Buzz Andrewson, Sales Lead, YourCo

                  - Definitely want him on the team to keep him updated with the
                    latest

                  - Make sure he does not over extend… repeatedly ask him, “What
                    update will you give the customer?”

              - Aubree Sapien, HR, YourCo

                  - Normally NOT part of the direct team, but due to the risk of
                    ‘burnout’ for this CRITICAL project she is to monitor the
                    human resources and offer suggestions to the Project Team and
                    supervisors

              - Alicia Pence, CFO, YourCo

                  - Normally NOT part of the direct team, but due to the risk of
                    major budget cost overruns for this CRITICAL project she is to
                    monitor the daily financial numbers to provide the fastest
                    response time possible for corrective action

              - Johnny Schnauzer, Warehouse Supervisor, YourCo

                  - He is the one to ensure the packing is PERFECT

              - Peter Spike, Production Manager

                  - He is the one to make sure parts are built to specification

              - Missing?

                  - Purchasing

                  - Engineering

            **<span class="underline">Indirect:</span>**

              - Bill Williamson, CEO, WhinerCo

                  - He is the one that authorizes the check to be written. He is the
                    MOST POWERFUL stakeholder… the customer

              - Matt Schlosser-Lovely, Maintenance, YourCo

                  - He is affected by the schedule adjustments but likely only
                    requires a weekly meeting to advise him

                  - If there are updates or changes, he must be notified immediately

              - YourCo Corrective Action/Preventative Action (CAPA) team

                  - These CA’s must be processed quickly to clear them

                  - They should be a separate or sub-project

              - YourCo Inspectors

                  - They must have training on the Z1.4 sampling plans

                  - Their schedules must be constantly monitored and controlled to
                    maximize output

                      - DEEPLY consider hiring competent help

                      - Less competent help can be hired as long as they stick with
                        the menial tasks, like filling out paperwork, packing,
                        cleaning, and so on

              - YourCo Team – ALL that touch the new parts

                  - EVERYONE on this team must go through extensive training on
                    proper handling of these parts

                      - This includes samples of INCORRECT handling methods – ‘what
                        ruins the parts’
