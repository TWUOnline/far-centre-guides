#### FAR Centre Activity 1.2.0: Watch YouTube’s ‘Good vs Bad PM’s”

This video discusses 13 areas to evaluate yourself as a Project Manager. There are a couple of assumptions that drive this, and they are presented at the beginning. As you watch, think of the top three that pertain to you (those you have the strongest skills at). Plus, think of the three that you are the weakest at. A handout will be provided to assist you in this. You’ll be sharing your self-assessment, so take good notes.

  - Facilitator Note: Handout: []“The 13 Traits of a Good Project Manager.”](U1-13-Traits-of-a-Good-Project-Manager.docx) This is just a list of the words noted in the video as a refresher to students.

#### FAR Centre Activity 1.2.1: Personalizing the 13 Areas to Evaluate Yourself as a PM

After watching the video, you are to consider the 13 areas presented in the video and determine which 3 you are strongest in… plus, you are to determine your weakest areas.

#### FAR Centre Activity 1.2.1: Sharing their Top and Bottom 3 Areas

All students will present their top and bottom 3 areas, AND providing examples to support their choices. This should take about 3 minutes per student.

  - Facilitator Note: Provide feedback to the instructor on the student’s self-honesty and openness. There is no wrong answer\! But students must be able to defend their choices.
