## Unit 1:

This is the intro session that discusses the activities that make up project management. Your primary actions are:

Review the syllabus with students and encourage them to please follow the suggested due dates.
-   Play the web-based videos.

-   Encourage discussion.

-   If a student or team is lacking, offer time for revision before you move
        on.

-   This week has lots of personal reflection, so there are no single
        ‘correct’ answers… no student should think that one type is better or
        worse than another.
- Optional: **Course Cafe:** Plan icebreaker activity based on Course Café introductions (e.g. peer interview)
