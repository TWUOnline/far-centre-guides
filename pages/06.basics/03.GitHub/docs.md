GitHub is a software development platform used by TWU GLOBAL's Online Learning Department. It is a well-recognized program that provides access to the repositories of online projects (e.g. TWU web pages, Moodle) for whoever uses it, and it keeps track of all changes made to a project while keeping earlier drafts. In this section, you will learn how to download GitHub and get started with using the platform.
