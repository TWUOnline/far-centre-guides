## The Challenge

The challenge we face in deploying TWU courses in sometimes radically different cultural contexts around the world is that different cultural contexts require different learning contexts. An illustrative example of a concept that makes sense in Canada won't necessarily make sense in China, Zimbabwe, Kenya, or India. A Canadian student is much more likely to understand the concept of distillation in the context of making maple syrup than an Indian student. And the opposite is also true. An illustration of the concept of distillation for an Indian student will lack context for a Kenyan student. Students in all of these context will need to understand distillation, but they will go about it in different ways.

So, the `core content` (understanding distillation) will be consistent across FAR Centres, but the `logistics` (the learning activities and contextualized examples) of how students learn that concept *must* be different. This presents a challenge for us, especially given our teaching model in which TWU faculty responsible for the design and assessment of student learning outcomes will primarily be located in BC, while FAR Centre Coaches responsible for the day-to-day logistics of any given course will be spread around the world in various locations.

We need a system that allows TWU faculty in BC to author and revise the core content in their course and automatically distribute that content to all FAR Centres. The system also needs to allow FAR Coaches to adjust the logistics in their version of the course, incorporate contextualized examples, and manage the in-class activities in *their* location. At the same time, we can't allow coaches in India to adjust the logistics of a course running in China, nor can we allow coaches to edit the core content of a course outside the direction and supervision of the TWU faculty in BC.

## The Solution

In order to manage this complexity, we need to disaggregate `core content` and `logistics` in FAR Centre courses.

#### Core Content

Core content for any given course will be created in a collaborative process of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) working with a TWU Instructional Designer (ID) using the technology platform most suitable for that process. The planning stage, where the course blueprint is created and revised, will likely happen in Google Docs, while content authoring will likely take place using MS Word.

Once the content has been authored, it will be transferred to a GitHub repository. GitHub is built on git technology, which is a system of automatically tracking
