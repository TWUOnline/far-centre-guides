The emphasis of the course will be on the theoretical and practical elements of

basic filmmaking. The projects will reveal how well they are grasping the course material, and the journals are designed to help the students to fully engage the course.

The following are objectives that must be met

for each exercise and project:

1\. The Composition exercises are designed to familiarize students to basic principles and practices that make for alluring and fascinating visual images.

2\. The Motion Shots exercises are designed to help students understand why movies are called moving pictures and to learn how to create motivated shots so that the camera and subject motion are in sync with each other.

3\. The Montage exercise is designed to allow the students to explore the way image and sound interplay in the creation of story, mood, concept, etc. and the important role editing plays in the flow and mix of picture and sound.

4\. The Short Film project is a capstone (final) exercise that allows the student to more fully integrate composition and cinematic motion into a fiction or non-fiction piece that communicates with the intended audience.

5\. The journals are designed to help the students process the course material and to more fully engage with both the course content and the work of their peers.

There are key documents for each assessment in this course. These are available online (in Moodle) for students. Be sure to review these important documents with students and contact the professor if any details are unclear.

**Note that once the Facilitator has mapped out the course (specific units to dates), send the updated syllabus to the instructor.**

# Course Resources

  - The course textbook is: Vankevich, N.. (2019). *Digital Filmmaking: A Beginner’s Guide to Mastering the Craft.* Epub. . The instructor will provide students an e-copy of the text.

  - Module links provided in Moodle and Course Text.

  - IMPORTANT NOTE: The units of this course correspond well with the chapters of the assigned textbook. Students must study both the units and the assigned chapters from the course text. Sometimes the material will overlap, but often the unit material and the chapter material will support and augment each other.

  - Before you begin each unit, encourage students to skim the sections of the required chapter. Then, read through how the unit is organized on Moodle (e.g. learning outcomes, topics, learning activities). Remind the students to create journal entries based on their reflections and responses to the course text and Moodle units.

  - Remind students to take notes on the course text and units. Questions or points of clarification can also be noted. This can act as a personal resource or study guide for students. The online text also has useful resources to help you study. Be sure to watch the videos. This process will reinforce what they are learning and help them do well in the course.

  - Facilitators will have access to the online textbook, in case they want to make notes, highlight content, etc.

# **Online Learning Activities**

  - Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week. They need to read the textbook chapters, the overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning activities.

  - Online learning activities include questions that we ask students to answer in a Reflective Journal, videos that explain topics further, and links to helpful Internet resources in both the Units and the course text.

  - As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class.

# **In-class Learning Activities**

### Discussions

  - In the online course, we give several prompts for students to think about. As you review the unit and plan your week, consider the questions that would inspire an engaging group/class discussion.

  - Students are encouraged to bring their **Reflective Journal** to class, as it has notes from the online activities and their responses to the course material and peer projects. Choose which topics they can share with a partner/group. Encourage them to add reflections to their journal after the class.  

  - Guidelines for how to pitch will be provided for the course.

### Project Pitches: and Team Collaboration 

  - **Students will pitch their projects to their peers and present the title, genre, and a brief synopsis of the Montage and Final Film they want to do. Students can also ask if anyone in the class would like to join them on their project.**

  - **However, it is vital to stress that the workload must be equal. That is, that one person must not do all of the work. It should be a true collaboration as the students in the teams decide who will write, produce, direct, shoot, and edit the projects.**

  - Those wanting to work in teams must get permission from the instructor to ensure that the size of the project justifies collaboration and that the workload is equally shared. The students will send a written copy of the pitch and a description of who will be doing what on the project.

#### Grading: 

  - The facilitator does not grade or mark the exercises and projects. However, you have the opportunity to give feedback about the student’s work. This can be in the form of a simple comment or checked box. For example,the student’s film Electrified the Room, Opened my eyes, Put me to sleep, Dulled the moment, Inspired me, Made me laugh or afraid, etc. In particular, make a note if the student’s project connected well with the audience (you observe that audience responded to it positively **or identified with the material)**

  - Send these comments to the Instructor and/or add to the student feedback form.   

  - Always include the **student ID number** as well as the name with every assessment/note to the instructor.

#### Self-Evaluation

  - Note that students are asked to reflect on their own projects in their journals. Refer to the Self-Evaluation guidelines.

<!-- end list -->

  - Remind students to not be too hard on themselves. They may be just beginning and it takes a long time to master the art and craft of public speaking.

#### Celebration Speech Presentations

  - **For the Unit 10 celebration session – make it a party\! Ask students to bring food, non-alcoholic drinks, invite family and friends.**

  - **Invitations to family and friends should be relative to the venue (try to book an auditorium)**

  - If there is time and you feel comfortable doing so, feel free to give an encouraging comment about each student.

  - The Facilitator will need to print the awards for Best Short Film, Best Montage, Most Improved Film, etc. on a thick paper stock (good quality). See **template** provided. This should be signed by the Facilitator, and use a handwriting font for the instructor’s signature (e.g. Ned Vankevich, Ph.D)

# Lesson Notes & Activities

The following are specific notes from the instructor about the units:

  - Be sure to go to the Moodle site and review each unit and corresponding learning outcomes in detail. You may want to ask students to complete certain activities before each class so they are prepared to participate.

  - For many of the activities in the online units, students are asked to write their thoughts in a journal. Consider having students share with a partner, group or whole class, depending on the questions presented. E.g. Share with a partner why you think public speaking is important.

### Unit 1

  - The following exercises can help the students to overcome speech anxiety and gain confidence in their ability to speak in front of others. It will also help you and them get to know their classmates.

<!-- end list -->

  - To help the students bond, have everyone individually come to the front of the class and give a short presentation or introduction of who they are, favorite things to do, favorite movies, music, food, and what filmmaking experience they have. This should take one to two minutes.

  - After each classmate finishes introducing his or her self the whole class will clap, cheer, stomp their feet, and shout phrases like the following: well done, bravo, loved it, etc. as a way to encourage the speaker.

### Unit 2

  - Encourage students to share their vision of how this course can help them in life:

<!-- end list -->

  - They can share their future goals,what excites them, and their life passion.

  - Ask them what phase of the filmmaking process appeals to them and why.

  - Encourage them to consider and share how this course can help them professionally and personally even if they do not want to be a filmmaker.

  - Encourage them to fully engage with the course text and Moodle Units.

  - Have them share their first journal entries to see if they are being too vague or conversely, getting caught up in too much detail.

### Unit 3:

  - Encourage students to find examples of excellent compositions from famous professional photographs and explain why they are so great (for instance, what makes them effective? What emotions do the photographs evoke?)Chapter 3 of the course text mentions some of these.

### Unit 4

  - Encourage students to find examples of excellent cinematic motion shots from famous filmmakers and films and explain why they are so great. Chapter 4 of the course text mentions some of these.

### Unit 5

  - Encourage students to find an example of a mini-movie that thrills or inspires them and share why. Vimeo and YouTube has many of these.

### Unit 6

  - Encourage students to find an example of a film montage or music video that thrills or inspires them and share why. Vimeo and YouTube has many of these.

### Unit 7

  - Encourage students to share the type of film genres and stories they are interested in and why.

### Unit 8

  - Ask the students what they are struggling with in the course or finding challenging. Let the instructor know if “red flag” issues arise.

### Unit 9

  - Have the students share some of their most challenging issues or “Murphy’s Law” moments and how they did or did not overcome them during the making of their final project.

### Unit 10

  - Have the students give words of affirmation andencouragement to their peers as they head out into the world to apply their skills and insights.
