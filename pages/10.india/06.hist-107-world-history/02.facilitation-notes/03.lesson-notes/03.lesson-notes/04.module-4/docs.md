###Unit 4: The Early Modern World,  1450 - 1750

####Unit 4: Topic 1

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are activities to help students understand chapter 12:

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

**Comparison (large or small group)** “Mesoamerica and the world.”

By this point, students should have learned about a wide array of governments; thus this discussion topic provides a useful time for review. Ask groups of students to list the following empires by their degree of government complexity and to be prepared to defend their choices:

   •   Abbasid caliphate
   •   Alexander the Great’s empire
   •   Han dynasty China
   •   Ming dynasty China
   •   Mongol Empire
   •   Mughal Empire
   •   Persian Empire
   •   Roman Empire
   •   Songhay Empire
   •   Xiongnu Empire

Then ask them to add the Aztec and Inca empires to the ordered list they have established, defending their placement.

**Contextualization (large or small group)** “What if . . . ?”

Ask students to decide on what they regard as a key historical turning point, a “day that the world changed” in world history up to the year 1500 c.e. This could of course be anything from a decisive battle to an invention to the suggestions given in the Reflections section of Chapter 12. It is important to emphasize that the turning point they choose should not be something that was going to happen soon anyway—e.g., if the Ottomans hadn’t conquered Constantinople in 1453 they would surely have taken it in a few years, or if Og had not discovered that it was possible to make a sharp stone tool, Grawp would probably have done so. After each group has chosen a plausible turning point, ask them to theorize what the consequences would have been if that event had gone differently.

**Review exercise (large or small group)** “A roadmap of world history.”

We already introduced these concepts  in the Learning Lab for Topic 2, but now students will be better equipped to participate more fully. For this classroom activity, we suggest that you map out, with the class, two possible ways to study by association rather than by rote: the timeline and the thematic outline.

   •   For the timeline, you will need a large chalkboard or equivalent. Draw four very long horizontal lines, labeling them “Asia,” “Europe,” “Africa,” and “The Americas.” Mark off centuries with short vertical lines. Then ask the class to suggest items to add to the list. Encourage students to participate—for example, by asking other students to provide the time when a particular student has named an event. Ask leading questions to fill in gaps, with an eye toward cultural and religious events as well as political ones. Don’t let students ignore the early societies covered in this text.
   •   Explain to students the basic concept of memory by association, such as when they make an outline of points relating to a major theme and then study the points as a whole. Then, with the class, make a list of the course’s major themes to date. Offer suggestions for the sorts of points that might be included under each theme. Finally, choose a single theme and sketch out a more detailed outline, soliciting as much input as possible from the students.

####Unit 4: Topic 2

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are activities to help students understand chapters 13 & 14:

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

**Comparison (large or small group)** “Conquest and religion in the Old World and the New.”  

Religion is a major sub-theme of colonization and conquest. Ask students to chart out the religious policies of various conquerors (Spaniards, Brazilians, Britons, Russians, Ottomans, and Mughals) and then rate them on scales of interest in religion and religious tolerance. Some supplemental questions to ask are:

   •   When was religious toleration most likely?
   •   What conditions made it most likely that the conquerors would try to convert their subjects?
   •   Do you see a difference in conquerors’ reactions depending on whether the subjects’ religion is monotheistic or polytheistic?
   •   In the early modern period, do some religions (or at least the rulers who practiced them) appear to have been more tolerant than others?
   •   What nonreligious factors might affect how tolerant a state was toward religious diversity?

**Map-analysis exercise (large or small group)** “Colonial powers, before and after.”  

Display a map, preferably a physical map of the world. Ask students to identify the core lands of the states that became major imperial powers in the early modern period and then to identify the lands that those states succeeded in claiming. This exercise is particularly effective if your projection equipment allows you to color over or circle parts of the map. Discuss the implications of these expansions.

**Comparison (large or small group)** “The impact of silver.”

This discussion question requires students to consider the many varied implications of the rapid expansion of the world silver supply after 1500 because of increased production in Bolivia and Japan. First ask your students to trace the flow of silver from the Bolivian mine at Potosí. Where did it go and what was it used for? Make sure that students address how it helped to fund multiple trading networks, from the Atlantic slave trade to the Indian Ocean spice trade. What impact did it have on Spain and the rest of Western Europe? Where did the silver end up? Why? What can these flows tell us about the world economy at the time? Conclude by asking students if they think that developments would have been different if new sources of silver had not been discovered.

**Role-playing exercise (small group)** “Justifying slavery.”

Choose three groups to represent slaveholders (1) in West Africa, (2) in the Caribbean, and (3) in the British colonies of North America. Ask each group to do some research and then to present to the rest of the class a five-minute defense of slavery as they practice it. After all three groups have presented, the role of the rest of the class will be to debate against the presenters. The greatest challenge to all the students engaged will be to remain true to cultural mores of the early modern period—make it clear in the assignment that you are the representative of the anachronism police and will not allow anachronism to drift in.

###Unit 4: Topic 3

**Notes for Facilitator:**

Here are activities to help students understand chapter 15:

**Discussion question review (small group)**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions that they responded to in the online forum, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. [link to participation grade rubric]

**Comparison (large or small group)** “The effects of the Reformations.”

Ask students to outline the effects of the Reformation movements on European society. Besides reviewing the chapter material, this provides students with an opportunity to practice making outlines.

**Misconception/Difficult topic (large or small group)** “Conversion is an all-or-nothing experience.”

This chapter gives a thoughtful presentation of the processes of syncretism and accommodation that accompany the conversion of people from one religion to another. Yet this topic is difficult for many students, especially if they are asked to regard Christianity with non-Christian elements as a valid religion. A broad discussion that encourages students to pull in material from earlier chapters would probably serve you best when addressing this topic. Encourage discussion of the following questions:

   •   What are the major types of religious syncretism discussed in the chapter? (Be sure to encourage a discussion of Islam, Confucianism, and Hinduism, not just Christianity.)
   •   Where’s the dividing line between cultural practices and religious practices?
   •   Is there a religious practice anywhere in the world today that is not in some way syncretic?

**Contextualization (large or small group)** “What did we get from the Scientific Revolution?”

Ask students to discuss and list both objects and attitudes of the present day that we would not have if it had not been for the Scientific Revolution. Encourage students not to itemize hundreds of individual inventions but to focus on the big picture. Lead them to include less tangible things, such as the notion that democracy is the ideal form of human society, or watching football on Sundays instead of going to church.
