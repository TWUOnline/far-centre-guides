## Course Description

This course involves a general examination of primary themes in the history of the world's major civilizations from antiquity to the 18th Century. Although European realities will be examined, the focus of this course will be global in nature with an emphasis on systems of cultural and economic exchange and on the global nature of historical development. As a part of this process students are provided with the opportunity to use the historical method, including primary sources, to understand and write accounts of the past. 

## Core Competencies and Learning Outcomes
Students of History 107 will:

**1.     Build historical knowledge**.

>   a.  Gather and contextualize information in order to convey both the
>   particularity of past lives and the scale of human experience.

>   b. Recognize how humans in the past shaped their own unique historical
>   moments and were shaped by those moments.

>   c.  Develop a body of historical knowledge with breadth of time and place—as
>   well as depth of detail—in order to discern context.

>   d. Distinguish the past from our very different present.

**2.     Develop historical methods.**

>   a.  Recognize history as an interpretive account of the human past—one that
>   historians create in the present from surviving evidence.

>   b.   Collect, sift, organize, question, synthesize, and interpret complex
>   material, equipping graduates to engage knowledgeably and critically in
>   their workplaces and personal lives.

>   c.  Practice ethical historical inquiry that makes use of and acknowledges
>   sources from the past as well as the scholars who have interpreted that
>   past.

>   d.  Develop empathy toward people in the context of their distinctive
>   historical moments.

**3.     Recognize the provisional nature of knowledge, the disciplinary
preference for complexity, and the comfort with ambiguity that history
requires.**

>   a.   Welcome contradictory perspectives and data, which enable us to provide
>   more accurate accounts and construct stronger arguments.

>   b.   Describe past events from multiple perspectives.

>   c.   Explain and justify multiple causes of complex events and phenomena
>   using conflicting sources.

>   d.   Identify, summarize, appraise, and synthesize other scholars’
>   historical arguments.

>   e.   Be comfortable with uncertainty.

4.     **Apply the range of skills it takes to decode the historical record
because of its incomplete, complex, and contradictory nature.**

>   a.   Consider a variety of historical sources for credibility, position,
>   perspective, and relevance.

>   b.   Evaluate historical arguments, explaining how they were constructed and
>   might be improved.

>   c.   Revise analyses and narratives when new evidence requires it.

 

**5.     Create historical arguments and narratives.**

>   a.   Generate substantive, open-ended questions about the past and develop
>   research strategies to answer them.

>   b.   Craft well-supported historical narratives, arguments, and reports of
>   research findings in a variety of media for a variety of audiences.

 

**5.     Use historical perspective as central to engaged global citizenship and
Christian discipleship. **

>   a.   Apply historical knowledge and historical thinking to contemporary
>   issues.

>   b.  Develop positions that reflect deliberation, cooperation, and diverse
>   perspectives.

## Course Policies:

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

As Christian scholars pursuing higher education, academic integrity is a core
value of the entire TWU community. Students are invited into this scholarly
culture and required to abide by the principles of sound academic scholarship at
TWU. This includes, but is not limited to, **avoiding all forms of plagiarism
and cheating in scholarly work**. TWU has a strict policy on plagiarism.
Learning what constitutes plagiarism and avoiding it is the student's
responsibility. For details on this, and on identifying and avoiding plagiarism
see the section on Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism in the TWU Student
Handbook.

Academic dishonesty can include (but is not limited to) presenting someone
else’s ideas or words as your own, quoting another source without providing a
proper citation, failing to place quotation marks around quoted material,
allowing another student to copy your work, submitting a paper you have written
for one course to another course without first obtaining permission from both
instructors, purchasing or downloading an essay on the Internet, or having
another person write an essay for you.

Any act of academic dishonesty will result in a minimum of a failing grade
(zero) for the course work affected by academic dishonesty; serious cases of
academic dishonesty may result in failure of the course and expulsion from the
university.

**COMMITMENT TO VIEWPOINT DIVERSITY, MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING, AND CONSTRUCTIVE
DISAGREEMENT**

In order to create an online classroom environment that supports respectful,
critical inquiry through the free exchange of ideas, the following principles
will guide our work:

-   Treat every member of the class with respect, even if you disagree with
    their opinion;

-   Seek first to understand, then be understood;

-   Bring light, not heat;

-   Reasonable minds can differ on any number of perspectives, opinions, and
    conclusions yet no ideas are immune from scrutiny and debate;

-   Because constructive disagreement sharpens thinking, deepens understanding,
    and reveals novel insights, it is not just encouraged, it is expected;

-   The science of inquiry requires citation of data and evidence, not your
    personal opinion.

**MEDIA AND EXTERNAL LINK CONTENT DISCLAIMER**

This course seeks to use media and external links consistent with the course
objectives noted above and the latest research regarding the class subject area,
however the Instructor and Trinity Western University do not necessarily endorse
specific personal, religious, philosophical, or political positions espoused by
the creators of these materials or the other elements on the webpage where the
content is housed.

**COMMUNICATION**

The best way to communicate with the instructor is by email
(Darren.Provost\@TWU.ca). I will try to return emails within 24 hours. Please
note that I do not check email between approximately 6:00pm on Saturday and
8:00am on Monday.

**If you are having difficulties with any of the assignments, please contact the
instructor before the assignment due date. If there is a valid reason why you
cannot complete an assignment before it is due (such as an illness that requires
hospitalization or a death in the immediate family), he would be happy to
discuss it with you before the assignment due date.** Note: Computer problems
are *never* an acceptable excuse for late assignments.

If you have specific questions about certain aspects of the course, chances are
that others will have the same question, so please post these questions on the
“General questions forum” located on the class website. Also check with your
Facilitator.

| A                | **Outstanding, excellent work**; exceptional performance with strong evidence of original thinking, good organization, meticulous concern for documented evidence, and obvious capacity to analyze, synthesize, evaluate, discern, justify, and elaborate; frequent evidence of both verbal eloquence and perceptive insight in written expression; excellent problem-solving ability in scientific or mathematical contexts with virtually no computational errors; demonstrated masterful grasp of subject matter and its implications. Gives evidence of an extensive and detailed knowledge base. (Note: The A+ grade is reserved for very rare students of exceptional intellectual prowess and accomplishment, especially in lower level courses.) |
| B                | **Good, competent work**; laudable performance with evidence of some original thinking, careful organization; satisfactory critical and analytical capacity; reasonably error-free expository written expression, with clear, focused thesis and well-supported, documented, relevant arguments; good problem-solving ability, with few computational or conceptual errors in scientific subjects; reasonably good grasp of subject matter but an occasional lack of depth of discernment; evidence of reasonable familiarity with course subject matter, both concepts and key issues. Exhibits a serious, responsible engagement with the course content.                                                                                              |
| C                | **Adequate, reasonably satisfactory work**; fair performance but infrequent evidence of original thinking or the capacity to analyze, synthesize, or evaluate course material; undue reliance on rote memory; difficulty in applying knowledge in unfamiliar contexts; limited problem-solving ability in scientific subjects; fairly clear but quite uninspiring written expression with occasional problems in mechanics or syntax; weak in provision of documented, illustrative, or descriptive evidence; satisfactory grasp of basic elements of the course but frequent lapses in detailed understanding. Satisfies the minimum requirements of the course.                                                                                        |
| D                | **Minimally acceptable work**; relatively weak performance with little evidence of original thinking or ability to analyze or synthesize course material; nominal or weak problem-solving ability in scientific subjects; written expression frequently exhibits difficulty in articulating a central thesis or sustaining a coherent argument; ideas are trite or juvenile, without discernible development. Shows inadequate grasp of some basic elements of the course.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| F                | **Inadequate work**; poor performance that indicates a lack of understanding or misunderstanding of essential subject matter; seems easily distracted by the irrelevant; written expression is poorly organized, often incoherent, and rife with mechanical and diction errors. Shows little evidence of even basic competency in the course content or skills.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
