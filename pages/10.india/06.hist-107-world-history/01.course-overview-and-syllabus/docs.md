### Inclusive Classroom:
TWU is committed to an ethic of inclusion centred on the principles of hospitality, reciprocity and reconciliation. We seek to produce generous learning spaces that are based on respect for difference and are open to diverse views, opinions, and identities. We welcome and value all voices, including those that have been silenced on account of race, religious beliefs, colour, gender, physical or mental variations, age, ancestry, place of origin, marital status, family status, sex, and sexual orientation, or on any other grounds identified in applicable human rights law.

### GRADING GUIDELINES
Following is a description of the letter grading:

| **A range = Superior, exceptional, outstanding**. A+ 90-100%  A 85-89%  A- 80-84% | The assignment demonstrates critical, informed, and creative theological inquiry that reflects superior understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student demonstrates depth of insight beyond what is normally expected. Carefully nuanced reasoning and writing, free from material, structural and grammatical error are presupposed in this grade. |
|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **B range = Good.**  B+ 77-79%    B 73-76%    B- 70-72%                       | The assignment demonstrates ready command of full range of concepts and shows some critical, informed, and creative inquiry that reflects above average understanding of essential theological/historical concepts. This means the student has produced an assignment that is free from material, structural and grammatical errors.                                                    |
| **C range = Acceptable.**    C+ 67-69%  C 63-66%    C- 60-62%                | The assignment demonstrates satisfactory ability to describe overall picture and essential concepts. This means the student has completed the assignment in a manner involving no significant errors. Material may not be free from structural and grammatical errors. Nuanced reasoning is not demonstrated.                                                                           |

D+ 57-59%   D 53-56%    D- 50-52%           | The assignment demonstrates reasoning that is neither carefully nuanced nor coherently presented; writing is insufficient in depth of insight and/or use of texts; presentation is not free from material error in structure, spelling and grammar. This means that the student failed to respond adequately to the assignment and its intentions.                                      |
| **F = Unsatisfactory**.

### Academic Integrity and Avoiding Plagiarism at TWU
One of the core values of Trinity Western University is the integration of academic excellence with high standards of personal, moral, and spiritual integrity. The University considers it a serious offence when an individual attempts to gain unearned academic credit. It is the student’s responsibility to be informed about what constitutes academic dishonesty.
