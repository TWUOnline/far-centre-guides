## Unit 9: Path‐Goal Theory

This unit introduces students to the path– goal theory of leadership. This unit discusses how leaders motivate followers to accomplish designated goals. The stated goal of this theory is to enhance follower performance and follower satisfaction by focusing on follower motivation and the nature of the work tasks.  

These are the activities students are expected to complete before coming to the learning lab:

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Case Study Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 9, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1.  What is the underlying assumption of expectancy theory? How does this pose a challenge for the leader?

  2.  Identify four leadership styles associated with path–goal theory. Explain each style and relate it to styles described in other theories. Can leaders exhibit more than one style?

  3.  What practical examples can you think of for how leaders can enhance follower motivation?

  4.  What leadership traits or competencies are needed to be an effective motivator?

  5.  What is the follower’s role in path–goal theory?

  6.  Should a leader adapt his or her style to each individual follower, or to the work group as a whole?

  7.  How can a leader find out what is rewarding to followers about their work?

  8.  Do men and women leaders motivate followers differently?

  9.  Apply path–goal theory to a work group you are currently in. How well does the leader’s style match the follower characteristics and task characteristics of your work group?

### Part 2: Case Study Activity

Divide the class up into three different groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the case studies provided at the end of chapter 6. As a group, have the students read the case study together and answer the questions prepared at the end of the case study to guide discussion.

  -   Allow students to work on the case study and questions for 1 hour and then have students re-cap the key ideas discussed and present this information to the class in the last 30 minutes.

  -   The re-cap should highlight the key points from the discussion. Make sure to compare and contrast alternate viewpoints that came up during the discussion and emphasize the take-home messages that can be applied to future situations.

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each learning lab and then providing a score for each student at the end of the learning lab based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

***Note:*** An absence for **one** learning lab will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the learning lab is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response.

Next, they need to provide a case study response. They are asked to choose ONE of the case studies that interests them from Chapter 6 and answer the questions for it that are provided at the end of the case. This case study response is part 4 of 6.
