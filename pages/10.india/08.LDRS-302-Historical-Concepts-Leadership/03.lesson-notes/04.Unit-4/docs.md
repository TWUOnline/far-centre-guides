## Unit 4: The Principles of Scientific Management

In this unit, students will explore how companies maximized the productivity and efficiency of their workers in a scientific way during the industrial revolution. In this unit, the students will learn about the major contributors to the field of management theory and how their ideas are used today.

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Presentation Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 4, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1.  How did Taylor change people’s thinking about leadership and management?

  2.  Where do you see the impact of Taylor’s theory occurring today?

  3.  How did the Gilbreth’s change people’s thinking about leadership and management at the time?

  4.  Where do you see the impact of the motion studies occurring today?

  5.  What goals seem to dominate early management principles?

  6.  Are there any jobs today for which time and motion studies would make sense to do? Would any other skills need to be taught as well?

  7.  What do early management principles leave out?

  8.  What are the differences and similarities that you noticed between Demming’s TQM and Taylor’s Scientific Management?

  9.  How has scientific management thought influenced contemporary leadership?

  10. What are the strengths and the limitations of scientific management?

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each class and then providing a score for each student at the end of the class based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

***Note:*** An absence for **one** class will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 2: Presentation Activity

For this activity, divide students into 4-5 groups. The objective of this activity is to research a 21st century company that uses scientific management. Then the group will prepare a short presentation to provide the rest of the class with information about how that company uses scientific management principles.

**Prep**

*Presentations will be group projects*

-   The amount of time available to prepare for the presentation will be class time only.

*Set clear expectations for the presentations*

-   Give clear instructions. Things to consider include:

    -   How long should it be?

    -   What format should it be in (Powerpoint, Written on the board, A Handout, etc.)?

    -   Should students be ready to field questions?

-   If students are presenting in groups, provide an opportunity for peer feedback. This will relieve frustrations of unequal contribution to the group. 

**During**

*Keep track of time.*

-   As students are presenting, makes sure to be strict timekeeper. It is often helpful to have a 5- or 2-min warning signal so students know to speed up if they are not going to make the time limit. 

**After**

*Provide constructive feedback.*

-   After the presentation, provide students with constructive feedback on both the content and delivery of their presentation.

-   You can also allow for peer feedback, after first modeling what constructive feedback looks and sounds like.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the class is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response which includes writing a 400-500 word (1-2 pages double spaced) response to questions provided in the Unit 2 assessment page.

Next, they will need to complete Assignment \#2: Scientific Management Paper. This paper involves a 4-page response paper to Taylor’s book. Be sure to cite page numbers if you are using quotes (remember that I want to see your understanding of the quote, not just the quote – use quotes minimally). In your paper, address the following questions:

-   In your own words, what is Scientific Management?

-   What are 5 principles about Scientific Management that you agree with and why?

-   What are 5 principles about Scientific Management that you disagree with and why?

-   What are 3 principles can we learn from Scientific Management that apply to leadership practice today and how will you apply them to your own leadership?
