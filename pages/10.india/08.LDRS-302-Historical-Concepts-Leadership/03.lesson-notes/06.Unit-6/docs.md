## Unit 6: Skills Approach

This unit will explore the skills approach to leadership. This approach is the second of the transactional approaches. The skills approach is a leader-centered perspective that emphasizes the competencies of leaders, specifically the technical, human, and conceptual skills.

These are the activities students are expected to complete before coming to class:

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Case Study Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 6, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1. When the skills model was developed, what were researchers trying to explain?

  2. How do the problem-solving skills of leaders and managers differ?

  3. How does the skills approach fit with the nature of leadership development?

  4. How might leadership in the army be similar to/different from leadership in business, the arts, collegiate sports, or scientific research?

  5. How would leadership skills (technical, human, and conceptual) be used and expressed in an online environment?

  6. What are some examples of situations in which a leader must demonstrate behavioral flexibility?

  7. In pairs, think of an unusual or ill-defined organizational problem. Which of the nine key problem-solving skills are most important to solve this problem?

  8. Which of the nine key problem-solving skills are most important for the career you are in or planning to enter?

### Part 2: Case Study Activity

Divide the class up into three different groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the case studies provided at the end of chapter 3. As a group, have the students read the case study together and answer the questions prepared at the end of the case study to guide discussion.

  -   Each group will be responsible for leading the discussion with the guiding questions provided at the end of the case study.

  -   Teamwork and communication are key aspects of this exercise. If needed, call on students who haven’t spoken yet or instigate another rule to encourage participation.

  -   Each group will be responsible for recording key pieces of information discussed in the group.

  -   Write out key facts on the board for reference.

  -   Having the information written out makes it easier for students to reference during the discussion and helps maintain everyone on the same page. 

  -   Keep an eye on the clock and make sure students are moving through the case study and questions at a reasonable pace.

  -   Allow students to work on the case study and questions for 1 hour and then have students re-cap the key ideas discussed and present this information to the class in the last 30 minutes.

  -   The re-cap should highlight the key points from the discussion. Make sure to compare and contrast alternate viewpoints that came up during the discussion and emphasize the take-home messages that can be applied to future situations.

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each class and then providing a score for each student at the end of the class based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| N*ever to almost never:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates any contributions in class or small groups, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | S*ometimes to fairly often:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | *Very often to nearly always*: (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others. |
***Note:*** An absence for **one** class will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the class is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response which includes writing a 400-500 word (1-2 pages double spaced) response to questions provided in the Unit 6 assessment page.

Next, they need to provide a case study response. They are asked to choose ONE of the case studies that interests them from Chapter 3 and answer the questions for it that are provided at the end of the case.

They will record their response to the Case Study questions in a Word document or a Google document. The response should be no more than one page double-spaced. Label this Case Study 2. Keep this word document in a file folder on your computer because you will be adding to the document over the next 5 units. This case study response is part 2 of 6.
