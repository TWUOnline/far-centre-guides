## Unit 10: Leader-­Member Exchange Theory

This unit introduces you to the Leader-Member Exchange Theory (LMX). This theory makes the dyadic relationship between leaders and followers the focal point of the leadership process. Before LMX theory, researchers treated leadership as something leaders did toward all of their followers. This assumption implied that leaders treated followers in a collective way, as a group, using an average leadership style. LMX theory challenged this assumption and directed researchers’ attention to the differences that might exist between the leader and each of the leader’s followers.

These are the activities students are expected to complete before coming to class:

## What Will You Be Doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on the Case Study Activity (details below).

### Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 10, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1.  How does LMX theory challenge a basic assumption common to prior theories?

  2.  Contrast the experiences of in-group and out-group members. Have you observed groups that fit these descriptions in an organization in which you work or with which you affiliate? Give specific examples to support your observations.

  3.  Why is it important to measure LMX from both the perspective of the leader and follower?

  4.  In what ways has technology use enhanced or hindered your working relationship with a leader or follower? For example: texting (instead of phoning), use of social media sites (instead of in-person conversation), and so on.

  5.  Can you think of an example where a leader’s effective management of a conflict at work improved his/her relationship with followers?

  6.  How can LMX be used by CEOs to develop tactical relationships within their organizations?

### Part 2: Case Study Activity

Divide the class up into three different groups. Each group will be assigned to one of the case studies provided at the end of chapter 7. As a group, have the students read the case study together and answer the questions prepared at the end of the case study to guide discussion.

  -   Allow students to work on the case study and questions for 1 hour and then have students re-cap the key ideas discussed and present this information to the class in the last 30 minutes.

  -   The re-cap should highlight the key points from the discussion. Make sure to compare and contrast alternate viewpoints that came up during the discussion and emphasize the take-home messages that can be applied to future situations.

**Evaluating Group Discussions:**

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each class and then providing a score for each student at the end of the class based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| N*ever to almost never:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates any contributions in class or small groups, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | S*ometimes to fairly often:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | *Very often to nearly always*: (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others. |
***Note:*** An absence for **one** class will not result in a loss of participation marks.

### Part 3: Assignments Reminders

After the class is done remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response.

Next, they need to provide a case study response. They are asked to choose ONE of the case studies that interests them from Chapter 7 and answer the questions for it that are provided at the end of the case. This case study response is part 6 of 6.
