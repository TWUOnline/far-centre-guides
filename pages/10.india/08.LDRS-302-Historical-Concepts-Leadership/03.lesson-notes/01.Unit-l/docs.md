## Unit 1: Historical Perspectives on Leadership

In unit 1, students are introduced to the key concepts and developments of how the past has shaped our contemporary definitions and practices of leadership. The students will explore leadership throughout many historical periods to understand how and why events and societal development happened.  The information in this unit will help students set the stage for learning leadership lessons from the past.

The course has been designed in such away that the unit learning activities should be completed at home on the student’s own time.  These activities will include: readings, watching videos, writing in a learning journal.

For the very first class students will likely not arrive in class prepared for group discussions.  Please build in some time to allow the students to work on the learning activities in class and then let them know that for the next 9 days they should complete the learning activities at home and then come to class prepared for group discussions.

In unit 1, here is a list of learning activities that the students will complete during the first class.

### What you will be doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to covering discussion questions provided in Unit 1.

The tasks to complete in class today are:

  1.  Welcome students and orient them to the course.

  2.  Introductions – Facilitator and Students

  3.  Facilitate group discussions.

  4.  Preparing Journal Responses

### Preparing for Facilitating Group Discussions:

An effective group discussion generally has a number of elements:

  -   All members of the group have a chance to speak, expressing their own ideas and feelings freely, and to pursue and finish out their thoughts

  -   All members of the group can hear others’ ideas and feelings stated openly

  -   Group members can safely test out ideas that are not yet fully formed

  -   Group members can receive and respond to respectful but honest and constructive feedback.  Feedback could be positive, negative, or merely clarifying or correcting factual questions or errors, but is in all cases delivered respectfully.

  -   A variety of points of view are put forward and discussed

  -   The discussion is not dominated by any one person

  -   Arguments, while they may be spirited, are based on the content of ideas and opinions, not on personalities

  -   Even in disagreement, there’s an understanding that the group is working together to resolve a dispute, solve a problem, create a plan, make a decision, find principles all can agree on, or come to a conclusion from which it can move on to further discussion

### HOW DO YOU LEAD A GROUP DISCUSSION?


**Adapted from**
<https://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/leadership/group-facilitation/group-discussions/main>

***SET THE STAGE***

If you have time to prepare beforehand, there are a number of things you may be able to do to make the participants more comfortable, and thus to make discussion easier.

***Bring materials to help the discussion along***

Most discussions are aided by the use of newsprint and markers to record ideas.

***Become familiar with the purpose and content of the discussion***

If you have the opportunity, learn as much as possible about the topic under discussion.  This is not meant to make you the expert, but rather to allow you to ask good questions that will help the group generate ideas.

***Make sure everyone gets any necessary information, readings, or other material beforehand***

If participants are asked to read something, consider questions, complete a task, or otherwise prepare for the discussion, make sure that the assignment is attended to and used.  Don’t ask people to do something, and then ignore it.

### Establish Guidelines and Expectations for Respectful Discussion

A good facilitator helps the group set rules for itself, makes sure that everyone participates and that no one dominates, encourages the development and expression of all ideas, including “odd” ones, and safeguards an open process, where there are no foregone conclusions and everyone’s ideas are respected.  Facilitators are non-directive, and try to keep themselves out of the discussion, except to ask questions or make statements that advance it.  For most group discussions, the facilitator role is probably a good ideal to strive for. If most people in the group don’t know one another, it’s your job to establish a comfortable atmosphere and set the tone for the discussion.

***Help the group establish ground rules***

The ground rules of a group discussion are the guidelines that help to keep the discussion on track and prevent it from deteriorating into an argument.  Some you might suggest, if the group has trouble coming up with the first one or two:

-   **Everyone should treat everyone else with respect**: no name-calling, no emotional outbursts, no accusations.

-   **No arguments directed at people – only at ideas and opinions**.  Disagreement should be respectful – no ridicule.

-   **Don’t interrupt**.  Listen to the whole of others’ thoughts – actually listen, rather than just running over your own response in your head.

-   **Respect the group’s time**.  Try to keep your comments reasonably short and to the point, so that others have a chance to respond.

-   **Consider all comments seriously and try to evaluate them fairly**.  Others’ ideas and comments may change your mind, or vice versa: it’s important to be open to that.

-   **Don’t be defensive if someone disagrees with you**.  Evaluate both positions, and only continue to argue for yours if you continue to believe it’s right.

-   **Everyone is responsible for following and upholding the ground rules**.

### Lead the Discussion

How active you are might depend on your leadership style, but you definitely have some responsibilities here.  They include setting, or helping the group to set the discussion topic; fostering the open process; involving all participants; asking questions or offering ideas to advance the discussion; summarizing or clarifying important points, arguments, and ideas; and wrapping up the session.  Let’s look at these, as well as some do’s and don’t’s for discussion group leaders.

- ***Setting the topic***. If the group is meeting to discuss a specific issue or to plan something, the discussion topic is already set.  If the topic is unclear, then someone needs to help the group define it.  The leader – through asking the right questions, defining the problem, and encouraging ideas from the group – can play that role.

- ***Fostering the open process***. Nurturing the open process means paying attention to the process, content, and interpersonal dynamics of the discussion all at the same time – not a simple matter. As leader, your task is not to tell the group what to do, or to force particular conclusions, but rather to make sure that the group chooses an appropriate topic that meets its needs, that there are no “right” answers to start with (no foregone conclusions), that no one person or small group dominates the discussion, that everyone follows the ground rules, that discussion is civil and organized, and that all ideas are subjected to careful critical analysis.  You might comment on the process of the discussion or on interpersonal issues when it seems helpful (“We all seem to be picking on John here – what’s going on?”), or make reference to the open process itself (“We seem to be assuming that we’re supposed to believe X – is that true?”). Most of your actions as leader should be in the service of modeling or furthering the open process.

- ***Part of your job here is to protect unpopular or unusual ideas***  That doesn’t mean you have to agree with them, but that you have to make sure that they can be expressed, and that discussion of them is respectful, even in disagreement. (The exceptions are opinions or ideas that are discriminatory or downright false.)  Odd ideas often turn out to be correct and shouldn’t be stifled.

- ***Involving all participants***. This is part of fostering the open process but is important enough to deserve its own mention. To involve those who are less assertive or shy, or who simply can’t speak up quickly enough, you might ask directly for their opinion, encourage them with body language (smile when they say anything, lean and look toward them often), and be aware of when they want to speak and can’t break in.  It’s important both for process and for the exchange of ideas that everyone have plenty of opportunity to communicate their thoughts.

- ***Asking questions or offering ideas to advance the discussion***. The leader should be aware of the progress of the discussion and should be able to ask questions or provide information or arguments that stimulate thinking or take the discussion to the next step when necessary. If participants are having trouble grappling with the topic, getting sidetracked by trivial issues, or simply running out of steam, it’s the leader’s job to carry the discussion forward.

    - This is especially true when the group is stuck, either because two opposing ideas are at an impasse, or because no one is able or willing to say anything.  In these circumstances, the leader’s ability to identify points of agreement, or to ask the question that will get discussion moving again is crucial to the group’s effectiveness.

- ***Summarizing or clarifying important points, arguments, or ideas***. This task entails making sure that everyone understands a point that was just made, or the two sides of an argument.  It can include restating a conclusion the group has reached, or clarifying a particular idea or point made by an individual (“What I think I heard you say was…”).  The point is to make sure that everyone understands what the individual or group actually meant.

- ***Wrapping up the session***.  As the session ends, the leader should help the group review the discussion and make plans for next steps (more discussion sessions, action, involving other people or groups, etc.).

    -   The facilitator should also go over any assignments or tasks that were agreed to, make sure that every member knows what her responsibilities are, and review the deadlines for those responsibilities. 

    -   Other wrap-up steps include getting feedback on the session – including suggestions for making it better – pointing out the group’s accomplishments and thanking it for its work.

## Part 3: Lead the Group Discussion

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 1, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

1.  How would you personally define leadership?

2.  Describe what stood out to you about the evolution of the definition of leadership from the 1900’s until now.

3.  What is the difference between assigned leaders and emergent leaders?

4.  What are the four components identified as central to leadership? Why do you think these are important?

5.  What do you think are the similarities and differences between leadership and management?

6.  What is the relationship between leadership and power? Leadership and influence?

7.  What does it mean to lead oneself?

8.  Describe when, where and how leadership began.

9.  Describe how you think the concepts of leadership have changed from tribal to pre-industrial eras?

10. Why do you think it is important for leaders to study the history of leadership?

11. Where do you still see pre—industrial practices of leadership influencing current leadership practices today?

### Evaluating group discussions:

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each class and then providing a score for each student at the end of the class based on the rubric provided below.

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| N*ever to almost never:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by disengaged body language and no to rare comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates any contributions in class or small groups, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | S*ometimes to fairly often:* (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by somewhat to often engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates a contribution at least once in a class or small group discussion; (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) helps maintain a supportive space for others to speak. | *Very often to nearly always*: (a) demonstrates *active* listening (as indicated by fully engaged body language and comments that build on others’ remarks), (b) initiates more than one contribution in a class or small group discussion, (c) makes insightful or constructive comments, (d) creates a space for others to speak and takes initiative to include others. |

 ***Note:*** An absence for **one** class will not result in a loss of participation marks.                                                                       

Part 4: Explain the Journal Response:
-------------------------------------

After the class is done, remind students that they will need to work on their
first assignment during their homework time. This will be the journal response
which includes writing a 400-500 word (1-2 pages double spaced) response to
questions provided in the Unit 1 assessment page. If there is time at the end of
the class, walk students through the rubric (provided below) to help them
understand what is expected.

| **Mastering**                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Demonstrates a clear recognition of the vocabulary, concepts, and themes presented in the readings and class discussion by utilizing each throughout the journal entry.                                                                     |
| Journal entry illustrates a thorough description of material presented in the reflection question, readings, and the class discussion by providing appropriate explanations of material and descriptions or examples from past experiences. |
| Journal entry displays student’s proficiency in articulating the use of material included in both the reading and class discussion through incorporation of practical evaluation and programming ideas.                                     |

Unit 2 Notes
