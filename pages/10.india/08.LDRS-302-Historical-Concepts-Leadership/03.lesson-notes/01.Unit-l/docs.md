## Unit 1: Historical Perspectives on Leadership

In unit 1, students are introduced to the key concepts and developments of how the past has shaped our contemporary definitions and practices of leadership. The students will explore leadership throughout many historical periods to understand how and why events and societal development happened.  The information in this unit will help students set the stage for learning leadership lessons from the past.

The course has been designed in such away that the unit learning activities should be completed at home on the student’s own time.  These activities will include: readings, watching videos, writing in a learning journal.

For the very first class students will likely not arrive in class prepared for group discussions.  Please build in some time to allow the students to work on the learning activities in class and then let them know that for the next 9 days they should complete the learning activities at home and then come to class prepared for group discussions.

In unit 1, here is a list of learning activities that the students will complete during the first class.
