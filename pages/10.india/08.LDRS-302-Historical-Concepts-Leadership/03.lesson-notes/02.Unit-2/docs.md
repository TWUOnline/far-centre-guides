## Unit 2: Industrialization and the Idea of Management

In this unit, students are introduced to the idea of management and they will discover how this idea can be traced back to the start of the Industrial Revolution. In this unit, they will learn about the major contributors to the field of management theory and how their ideas are used today.

The students will arrive for learning lab prepared for group discussions based on what they have completed in their learning activities at home.  Specifically, students will have completed the following activities prior to attending the learning lab:

### What will you be doing?

Today you will have 3 hours in total with the students. The first 1.5hrs is devoted to facilitating group discussion and the second 1.5 hours will be focused on organizing the Jigsaw Activity.

**Part 1: Lead the Group Discussion:**

Divide the class into small groups. Have them discuss questions provided below, and then select a spokesperson who will summarize their findings for the rest of the class after you reconvene as a large group. Note: the same person should not be the spokesperson each week. The level of participation will contribute to each student’s individual participation grade. 

In Unit 2, the group discussion will focus on the following questions:

  1. How did the western industrial revolution form the idea of management?

  2. What is the difference between leadership and management?

  3. What are the similarities and the differences between the two broad positions on management of the four writers in the unit 2 (part 1) notes?

  4. Do these positions reflect some of your own ideas and assumptions about management?

  5. Do the distinctions between management as a science and management as an art reflect your own experiences?

  6. Did this unit challenge your ideas about management, or those of managers you have known, or the assumptions about management you have encountered in different organisations and contexts? If so, how?

  7. What do you see as the implications for practising managers if management is an art versus a science?

### Evaluating Group Discussions:

Part of your responsibility as the facilitator will be to evaluate student participation in group discussions. You can do this by keeping a student list with you in each learning lab and then providing a score for each student at the end of the learning lab based on the rubric provided below:

| **Emerging (0-64%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **Developing (65-89%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Mastering (90-100%)**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

***Note:*** An absence for **one** learning lab will not result in a loss of participation marks.         

### Part 2: Organize the Jigsaw Activity:

**Assign Topics to Student Groups:**

  -   For this activity, students will be divided into 4 groups. The number of students you have per group equals the number of topics that will be covered.

  -   Assign the following topics to each group: Frederick Taylor, Henri Fayol, Mary Parker Follett, Max Weber,

  -   After they receive their topic, the idea is that all of the students in the initial group will now become an expert on a historical leader. Instruct students to research the person and clearly identify 5 key ideas about that person. They will share this information with a teaching group so they need to have a good understanding of who the person was and what their important contributions were to the field of management.

  -    This Jigsaw activity will be completed in 1.5 hrs. To begin, students will work in their “expert” groups for 30 minutes and then students will reform in their “teaching” groups for 1 hour.

**Introduce the Activity:**

  -   Today we are going to do a classroom jigsaw. [Break students into expert groups]. You are now in your expert groups. Your task is to become experts on the historical leader. Spend the time you have together refining your understanding of the historical leader. After 30 minutes, we will break the expert groups up and re-form into teaching groups. Teaching groups contain one member from each expert group. You are now in your teaching groups for 1 hour. Each of you is an expert on a different historical leader. Your task now is to teach your topic to the other members of your group. You will have 15 minutes each to share this information with your group members.

**Keep Track of Time**

-   Remind students when it is time to move from their expert groups to their teaching groups.

-   Following the jigsaw session, the students will to write about the information covered or the insights they gleaned from the session in their journal response.

### Part 3: Assignment Reminders

After the learning lab is done, remind students that they will need to work on two assignments during their homework time. First, they will need to provide a Journal Response which includes writing a 400-500 word (1-2 pages double spaced) response to questions provided in the Unit 2 assessment page.

Next, they will need to complete ***Assignment #1: Historical Leader Paper.*** This paper involves writing a well-researched 2-3-page paper on a historical leader or writer on leadership of their choice. The students will need to describe the leader/writer’s 1) life, 2) his or her historical time, and 3) what you think made him or her a great leader (or thought leader).
