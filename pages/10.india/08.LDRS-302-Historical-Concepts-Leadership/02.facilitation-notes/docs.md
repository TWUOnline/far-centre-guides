In this section, we will outline a couple of key ideas to consider as you facilitate this course.  See below for advice on setting up your class schedule, facilitating activities and discussions, and guiding students through assessments.

### Class Schedule
Note that students will do part of the learning online, and part in the classroom.  This is a flipped classroom model where students engage with the content at home by reading the textbook, reading and viewing the course materials on Moodle as designed by the instructor, and preparing activities and assignments for the next class.  In class, they will engage in group discussions, assignments, and other activities in order to help them further engage with the course material.  

**Part 1: Sample Welcome Message and Orientation to the Course:**

I am excited to be your facilitator for LDRS 302 this fall. As you know the course begins today and will continue for the next 5 weeks.  Let’s take some time now to walk through the course and get a sense of what is ahead. 

This course is organized into 5 weekly units running from September 16, 2019-October 20, 2019. Each page of the course will provide you with the following information:

  -   A general overview of the topic that will be addressed during the unit.

  -   Specific learning outcomes and topics for the unit.

  -   Resources that you will need to address learning activities and assessments in the unit.

  -   Specific learning activities that you will need to complete each week at home before you come to class.

  -   Assessments pages will provide you with information about completing assignments each week.

There is a timeline on the course website that outlines for you when assignments are due and what your deliverables are each week. Please consult the timeline for an overview of what is expected each week.

For those who are new to using Moodle as the platform for your course content and for submitting assignments, then you can find information on how to navigate through this course on the tab provided [**HERE**](https://learn.twu.ca/course/view.php?id=7008&section=1).

Over the next 5 weeks, we will be meeting together for 3 hrs/2x per week. During our time together, I will be facilitating group discussions, answering questions, helping you with your assignments, and evaluating your participation in class.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to ask. I am here to help and be your guide on this journey into Historical Concepts and Theories of Leadership.

**Part 2: Introductions & Icebreaker**

Before we get started today, let’s all introduce ourselves and get to know each other as a class. I’d like everyone to share a little about who you are and why you are here taking this class. If you already know most of your classmates, be sure to include some new information they might not all know about you such as:

  -   General information about yourself as a person, a professional, and a
    student

  -   What your professional background is—whether you currently work in the field or you’re new to it.

  -   Your biggest question, doubt, or fear about the class.

  -   How did you come to enroll in this course or program?

  -   Do you have experience with the topic?

  -   What do you hope to gain from this class?

  -   Keep the information you include, and the tone you use (i.e., language, approach) professional and relevant to participation in the course.

  -   Include professional and personal information.

  -   Prepare an icebreaker activity

## Online Activities
Before each class, students are encouraged to view the entire unit that will be discussed that week.  They need to read the textbook chapters, the overviews provided by the instructor, and engage in several learning activities.  Learning activities include questions that we ask students to answer in a Reflective Journal (graded and ungraded), videos that explain topics further, and an ungraded key terms quiz. As you preview the week ahead with your class, point out activities that they must complete before they come to your class (e.g. Reflective journal due Wednesday in order to participate in discussion and submit to instructor on Moodle by Friday.


## Class Assignments & Learning Activities
Note that many classes will be devoted to certain assignments (discussions, ethics committee, presentations).  On the next page are the assignment details. Please refer to the course in Moodle for specifics.

## Graded Assignments

| **Assessment**               | **Grade**          | **Due Date** |

For assignment submission, students will submit via the assignment dropboxes in Moodle.


### Key Terms Review Activities
In addition to discussions, presentations, and preparing for assessments, you may want to practice key terms with the class.
Each unit has a key terms matching activity.  If there is class time (e.g. for an ice-breaker opening activity or the close of a lesson), engage students in some vocabulary activities.  

Here are a couple of examples:

- Word Sort: See instructions in [Faculty Focus: A New Way to Help Students Learn Course Vocabulary](https://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/effective-teaching-strategies/a-new-way-to-help-students-learn-course-vocabulary/)
- Semantic maps, Vocab on the Move, Brain Power Words: See instructions in [21 Ideas for Teaching Vocabulary](http://www.giftedguru.com/21_ideas_for_teaching_vocabulary/)
- [Vocabulary Building](https://www.saddleback.edu/tutoring/vocabulary-building)
- Guess Who? Prepare name tag stickers with philosophy perspectives (e.g. nihilist, moral subjectivist, moral objectivist, free will advocate, determinist, and compatibilist, utilitarian, etc.). Put the sticker on students backs and have them mingle, trying to guess from other's desciption what perspective they have.
